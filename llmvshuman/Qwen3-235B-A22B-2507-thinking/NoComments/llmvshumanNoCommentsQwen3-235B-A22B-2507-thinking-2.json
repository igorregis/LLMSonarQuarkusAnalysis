{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese specifying its purpose variables base and altura are intuitive the calculation follows the standard triangle area formula concisely without unnecessary complexity the logic is straightforward and immediately understandable requiring no additional comments for comprehension","tokens":728,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Portuguese variable names raio and area matching the method\u0027s purpose calcularAreaCirculo Constants like PI are well-defined and the logic is straightforward without unnecessary complexity The structure follows standard Java conventions making it easy to comprehend even for junior developers","tokens":741,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise with clear min/max updates but uses ambiguous terms like simpleSum and sumCompensation without context. The sumWithCompensation logic lacks comments making compensation strategy hard to grasp. Variable names could be more descriptive for better readability despite correct statistical operations","tokens":772,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name in Portuguese is clear for native speakers but magic numbers 3 reduce readability Lacks comments to explain the quarter logic ENUMS variable name is vague though the algorithm is concise and correct for its purpose","tokens":978,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and correctly implements leap year logic with proper parentheses. Portuguese method/variable names are acceptable given evaluator\u0027s context. Minor deduction for unnecessary if-else structure when direct boolean return would suffice improving conciseness without sacrificing clarity","tokens":1167,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese method and parameter names (subtrai meses soma) which violates Java naming conventions and hinders comprehension for international teams Despite simple logic the non-English terms significantly reduce readability and maintainability as Java ecosystem standardizes on English identifiers","tokens":1064,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and correctly handles modulo arithmetic for cyclic month calculation However variable names like amount and ENUMS lack clarity and the absence of comments makes the negative handling logic non-intuitive despite being technically sound","tokens":1205,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code uses unclear array indexing starting from 1 and string operations for digit manipulation instead of arithmetic. Variables in Portuguese but logic remains hard to follow due to non-intuitive loops null checks and redundant string conversions. Potential edge case returning 10 instead of 0. Moderate readability issues from structural complexity and lack of comments","tokens":1869,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear ternary structure however non-English method names like getMedia getContagem and getSoma reduce readability for developers unfamiliar with Portuguese which is not standard in Java ecosystems despite logical simplicity","tokens":1931,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code has clear logic and meaningful Portuguese variable names suitable for a native speaker. However variable declarations at the top instead of inline and a slightly complex font-check condition reduce readability. Consistent structure and concise method length aid comprehension despite minor style issues","tokens":2723,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
