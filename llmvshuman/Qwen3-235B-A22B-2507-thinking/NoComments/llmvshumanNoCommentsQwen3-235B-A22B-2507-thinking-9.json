{"score":"10","reasoning":"O código é altamente legível com nomes de variáveis em português claros raio e area além de uma constante PI bem definida A lógica é simples e direta sem complexidade desnecessária O uso de final para PI demonstra boa prática e a estrutura do método é concisa e autoexplicativa dentro do contexto de desenvolvimento em português","tokens":763,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity in variable naming and logic explanation The use of \u0027amount\u0027 and complex modulo operations without comments makes it hard to grasp especially for negative values The cast to int may confuse readers about potential overflow issues despite modulo 12 limiting the range","tokens":853,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear with meaningful Portuguese variable names and straightforward logic However the method name specifies isosceles triangle while the area formula applies to any triangle potentially causing minor confusion despite correct implementation The simplicity and correctness justify a high score","tokens":861,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name is descriptive in Portuguese but ENUMS variable lacks clarity. The (ordinal / 3) * 3 logic is mathematically correct for quarters but non-intuitive requiring mental parsing. Absence of comments or explanatory names like QUARTER_START_MONTHS reduces immediate comprehension despite functional correctness. Mixed language cues may confuse international teams","tokens":1217,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear Portuguese method names like getMedia getContagem and getSoma which align with the evaluator\u0027s native language The ternary operator efficiently handles division by zero logic without unnecessary complexity The structure is straightforward and adheres to good encapsulation practices making it highly readable and easy to comprehend within the given context","tokens":1239,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear logic for leap year calculation Method and variable names in Portuguese are appropriate for the target audience The redundant else block slightly reduces conciseness but does not hinder comprehension Overall structure is straightforward and easy to follow","tokens":1648,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear Portuguese variable names appropriate for the evaluator\u0027s context Logical flow is straightforward with meaningful constants and proper indentation Minor drawbacks include variable declarations at method top instead of loop scope and a slightly complex font validation condition without comments but overall highly comprehensible for target audience","tokens":2190,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code implements Luhn algorithm but uses inefficient string operations for digit sums and confusing array handling. Variables in Portuguese are acceptable but logic obscured by unnecessary String manipulations non-intuitive loop indices and lack of comments. Suboptimal structure reduces readability despite functional correctness","tokens":2652,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and follows a logical flow for combining statistics. However variable names like simpleSum and sumWithCompensation lack clarity without domain knowledge of numerical compensation techniques. The dual handling of sum components may confuse readers unfamiliar with Kahan summation algorithm. Structure is clean but would benefit from minor naming improvements or comments to enhance immediate comprehension for broader developer audiences","tokens":2829,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and logically correct using modulo for month cycling The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is grammatically appropriate in Portuguese for an instance method however the unconventional third-person verb form may slightly hinder immediate comprehension for developers accustomed to imperative naming conventions despite being technically correct","tokens":3713,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
