{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but suffers from unclear variable names like simpleSum and sumCompensation which obscure their purpose Without comments explaining the compensation logic likely for numerical stability comprehension is challenging for new developers despite correct structure and standard Math methods usage","tokens":752,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and correctly implements leap year logic. Using Portuguese variable/method names may hinder international readability but is acceptable in a Portuguese context. The if-else structure is slightly verbose as it could directly return the boolean expression but remains straightforward and easy to comprehend for its purpose","tokens":910,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"O código é extremamente claro e conciso com nomes de métodos e variáveis descritivos em português facilitando a compreensão para falantes nativos A lógica é simples e direta sem complexidade desnecessária A fórmula está implementada de forma legível e o propósito do método é imediatamente compreensível","tokens":924,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"O código é altamente legível com nomes de variáveis em português claros raio e area e constante PI bem definida A estrutura simples e direta facilita a compreensão imediata sem necessidade de comentários O uso de final para PI demonstra boa prática e a fórmula matemática é intuitiva mesmo com valor hardcoded em vez de Math PI","tokens":1031,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear Portuguese method names like getMedia getContagem and getSoma which align with the evaluator\u0027s native language enhancing comprehension The ternary operator is appropriately used for a straightforward conditional check avoiding division by zero The logic is self-explanatory with no unnecessary complexity or ambiguity","tokens":1168,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names like \u0027amount\u0027 instead of descriptive terms such as \u0027offset\u0027 Magic numbers 12 lack explanation and the modulo arithmetic for negative handling is non-intuitive without comments ENUMS reference assumes prior knowledge of enum patterns Casting long to int may confuse but is safe here Overall functional yet moderately readable","tokens":1423,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name in Portuguese is clear for native speakers but may confuse others The logic using ordinal division is concise yet relies on magic number 3 which reduces immediate clarity ENUMS reference lacks context but fits enum patterns Common quarter calculation though a named constant would improve readability","tokens":1389,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese variable names which may hinder international readability but is clear for native speakers The logic is sequential with a single loop however variables are declared at the top instead of near usage reducing clarity The font condition check lacks comments making it slightly hard to parse Overall structure is good but could improve with English terms and localized variable declarations","tokens":1871,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses non-standard 1-based array indexing in Java which is confusing and error-prone. Variable names in Portuguese may hinder international readability despite the context. Multiple string conversions and unclear loop logic increase cognitive load. Lack of comments explaining the algorithm steps reduces comprehension. The structure is logical but unconventional practices lower readability significantly","tokens":2790,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and leverages Portuguese naming which is clear for native speakers. Method names like subtrai and soma directly convey intent subtract and add. The logic using modulo 12 for month calculation is appropriate though lacks comments. Minor deduction for non-English terms potentially reducing broader readability despite correct local context","tokens":4127,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
