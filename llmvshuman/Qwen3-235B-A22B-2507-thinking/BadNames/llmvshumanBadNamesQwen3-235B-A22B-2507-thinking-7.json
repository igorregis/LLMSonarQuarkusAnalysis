{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers violating Java naming conventions and obscuring logic intent The method\u0027s purpose is unclear without domain knowledge and ordinal usage lacks context making comprehension difficult even for experienced developers","tokens":729,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb names for methods and variables paprica alecrim menta which obscure functionality Month return type suggests date logic but operations lack context Poor naming conventions and absence of comments severely hinder comprehension despite correct syntax","tokens":717,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 and parameters \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 are non-descriptive making purpose unclear. Variable \u0027r\u0027 lacks meaning. Despite simple logic the poor naming conventions significantly hinder comprehension without contextual clues. Basic structure is clean but violates fundamental readability practices expected in professional codebases","tokens":773,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use non-descriptive Portuguese terms unrelated to functionality obscuring intent Magic numbers like 3 lack explanation despite likely representing quarter logic The code structure is simple but poor naming severely hinders comprehension without contextual knowledge","tokens":808,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis e métodos em português baseados em alimentos (ex: abobora coxa feijaoVerde) que não descrevem a funcionalidade real prejudicando drasticamente a compreensão O método coxa não indica propósito claro e há uso inconsistente de tipos como feijaoVerde sendo tratado como objeto após declaração como int A lógica fica obscurecida pela falta de significado semântico nos identificadores mesmo para falantes nativos","tokens":1177,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name isAB and parameter a lack descriptive clarity obscuring the leap year logic intent Single-letter variables reduce readability The redundant if-else structure could be simplified to a direct boolean return Correct algorithm but poor naming significantly hinders comprehension without context","tokens":1023,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and follows basic structure but suffers from poor naming conventions. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague without context. Constant \u0027P\u0027 should be \u0027PI\u0027 for clarity and using Math.PI would improve precision and readability. Variables \u0027r\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 are acceptable in short scope but could be more descriptive. Overall logic is simple yet naming reduces immediate comprehension","tokens":1044,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese method names which may be clear to a native speaker but lack descriptive clarity even in that context Terms like getEspinafre and getJaca obscure the actual purpose without domain knowledge The ternary logic is simple but poor naming reduces readability significantly","tokens":1131,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variables (s d p n) making it hard to understand their purpose. Complex nested operations like ternary inside multiplication reduce clarity. Lack of comments explaining the algorithm (likely Luhn check digit) increases cognitive load. Array handling with unclear indices and unnecessary String conversions instead of charAt further hinder readability. Method name dv provides no semantic meaning","tokens":1345,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese vegetable names for variables and methods instead of meaningful terms obscuring intent DoubleSummaryStatistics is misused with non-standard fields causing confusion despite simple structure the naming convention severely hampers comprehension even for Portuguese speakers due to lack of semantic meaning","tokens":1530,"name":"Combine.java"}
