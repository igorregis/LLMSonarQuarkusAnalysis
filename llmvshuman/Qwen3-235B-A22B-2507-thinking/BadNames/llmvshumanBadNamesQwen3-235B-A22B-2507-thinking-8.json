{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and lacks descriptive meaning. Variable \u0027a\u0027 should be named \u0027year\u0027 for context. The if-else block is redundant as the condition can be directly returned. Despite correct leap year logic readability suffers from poor naming and unnecessary structure reducing comprehension ease","tokens":632,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses obscure variable and method names in Portuguese spices (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) which convey no semantic meaning. Critical context like pimentaCaiena array and ordinal usage is missing making logic hard to follow. Mathematical operations lack comments explaining purpose. Violates basic readability principles of meaningful naming and documentation","tokens":656,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 and single-letter parameters \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive meaning making purpose unclear without context variable \u0027r\u0027 is also non-descriptive despite simple logic poor naming conventions significantly reduce readability and maintainability for professional code standards","tokens":642,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English identifiers like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 which obscure meaning. Magic numbers (3) lack context and the logic for grouping months into quarters is unclear without comments or descriptive names. Violates Java naming conventions and reduces maintainability significantly","tokens":694,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb names for methods and variables paprica alecrim menta which obscure functionality Month return type suggests date logic but operations lack context Poor naming conventions and absence of comments severely hinder comprehension despite correct syntax","tokens":717,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related variable and method names (e.g. gengibre batata salsa) which severely hinder understanding. Lack of meaningful identifiers contradicts Java naming conventions and makes purpose unclear despite simple structure. English-speaking developers would struggle to comprehend logic without extensive context","tokens":891,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese method names like getBrocolis and getEspinafre which obscure intent Food-related terms lack domain relevance making logic hard to follow despite correct ternary structure Explicit 0.0d is good but overall readability suffers from meaningless identifiers without context","tokens":890,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related variable names like abobora feijaoVerde and inhame which obscure their purpose and violate Java naming conventions Standard practice requires meaningful English names for readability Even for a Portuguese speaker the irrelevant culinary terms hinder comprehension significantly The method coxa lacks clarity and the structure is hard to follow due to poor naming choices","tokens":1644,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and follows basic structure but suffers from poor naming conventions Method calc is vague P should be PI for clarity and a lacks descriptive meaning However the simple logic and common mathematical formula aid comprehension despite these issues","tokens":1487,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variables (d s n) making purpose unclear It processes digits for a check algorithm likely Luhn but lacks descriptive names Comments explaining steps are missing Array d is 1-based which is non-intuitive in Java String operations for digit sums instead of math reduce clarity Complex loops with multiple counters hinder comprehension Despite correct logic poor readability affects maintainability and debugging effort significantly","tokens":1905,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
