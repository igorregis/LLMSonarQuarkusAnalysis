{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and lacks descriptive meaning. The single-letter parameter \u0027a\u0027 reduces readability. The logic checks for leap years but uses redundant if-else structure instead of direct boolean return. Better naming and simplified return statement would significantly improve comprehension","tokens":726,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese variable and method names (paprica alecrim menta) which obscure intent Magic number 12 lacks context despite Month return type Method logic is cryptic without comments or meaningful identifiers severely hindering readability and comprehension for international developers","tokens":699,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers making it extremely hard to understand The logic involving modulo operations on months lacks context and proper naming conventions Magic numbers like 12 aren\u0027t explained and ordinal usage suggests enum context without clarity Overall poor readability due to obscure naming and lack of documentation","tokens":752,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Non-descriptive food-themed variable names (abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde) obscure logic intent Method name coxa lacks purpose clarity Potential type error with int feijaoVerde using nextFloat() Constant GRAO_DE_BICO unclear without context Boolean flag aboboraMaca meaningless without documentation Critical readability issues from culturally specific terms without documentation","tokens":1125,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague and parameters \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive names making purpose unclear. Variable \u0027r\u0027 offers no context. Despite simple arithmetic the poor naming conventions significantly hinder comprehension without additional documentation or context which is absent","tokens":1006,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague; variables \u0027P\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, and \u0027r\u0027 lack descriptive names. Hardcoded pi value instead of Math.PI reduces clarity. Short but poor naming conventions hinder comprehension despite simple logic","tokens":1028,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use non-English Portuguese terms violating Java naming conventions which expect English descriptors This severely hampers readability for international teams The logic calculating quarter-based Month is obscure without comments or semantic naming despite correct syntax Poor maintainability due to ambiguous intent and cultural/language-specific references","tokens":1047,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese method names like getBrocolis and getEspinafre which violate Java naming conventions favoring English terms reducing readability for broader teams despite correct ternary logic structure The lack of descriptive semantics makes intent unclear even for Portuguese speakers expecting standard domain terminology","tokens":1119,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code implements a Luhn algorithm but suffers from poor readability due to single-letter variables p d s n i lack of descriptive names and no comments explaining the logic The array d usage and nested operations obscure intent making comprehension difficult despite correct structure The method name dv provides no context requiring reverse-engineering for understanding","tokens":1596,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable and method names (e.g. gengibre batata salsa) which violate Java naming conventions and obscure intent even for Portuguese speakers as they lack domain relevance. Critical fields like batata or alecrim don\u0027t indicate purpose making logic impossible to decipher without context. Structure is simple but meaningless identifiers destroy readability","tokens":1580,"name":"Combine.java"}
