{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers making it extremely hard to understand The logic involving modulo operations on months is obscured by poor naming conventions and lack of comments No clear indication of business context or purpose severely impacts readability","tokens":655,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and non-descriptive; \u0027a\u0027 as variable name lacks context. The logic correctly checks leap year conditions but uses redundant if-else structure instead of direct boolean return. Improved naming and simplified return statement would significantly enhance readability and comprehension for maintainability","tokens":847,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variables (s d i n) making it hard to understand their purpose. Lack of comments obscures the algorithm\u0027s intent (likely a check digit calculation). Complex nested operations without intermediate variables increase cognitive load. Poor structure with multiple loops handling similar tasks without clear separation. Meaningful names and comments would drastically improve readability","tokens":1147,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Non-descriptive Portuguese herb names (paprica alecrim menta) obscure functionality; violates Java naming conventions; unclear purpose of modulo 12 and negation without context; zero documentation or meaningful identifiers hinder comprehension despite short length","tokens":942,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and variable names are non-descriptive (calc b a r) making purpose unclear without context Although logic is simple poor naming conventions significantly hinder readability and maintainability which is critical in professional codebases","tokens":967,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague and should specify the operation like \u0027calculateArea\u0027. Variables \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 lack clarity; \u0027PI\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 would improve readability. Using Math.PI instead of a hardcoded value is preferred. Despite correct logic the poor naming conventions reduce maintainability and comprehension for larger codebases","tokens":953,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 which obscure intent. The logic groups months into quarters via ordinal math but lacks clarity due to ambiguous identifiers and no comments. Critical context is missing making comprehension difficult despite simple structure","tokens":1011,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related terms for variables and methods (e.g. batata salsa abobora) instead of meaningful names indicating their purpose. While syntactically correct the complete lack of semantic clarity in identifiers makes understanding the logic impossible without external context violating basic readability principles even for Portuguese speakers","tokens":1219,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable and method names use irrelevant Portuguese food terms like abobora and alhoPoro instead of descriptive identifiers making purpose unclear even for Portuguese speakers Standard Java naming conventions are ignored severely hindering comprehension despite correct syntactic structure Potential type errors like int used as object further confuse logic","tokens":1752,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a clear ternary operation but suffers from non-descriptive Portuguese method names like getEspinafre and getJaca which obscure business logic Without context or comments it\u0027s hard to grasp the purpose of calculations despite correct syntax and final modifier usage Magic number 00d is acceptable but overall readability is hindered by ambiguous naming conventions","tokens":1896,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
