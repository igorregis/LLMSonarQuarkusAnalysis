{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear; variable \u0027a\u0027 lacks meaning. Logic correctly checks leap year but uses verbose if-else instead of direct return. Better naming (e.g. isLeapYear year) would improve readability. Short yet confusing due to poor identifiers. Score 6 reflects functional but suboptimal clarity","tokens":713,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use irrelevant Portuguese herb terms instead of domain-appropriate names. The logic involving ordinal manipulation lacks clarity without comments. Non-descriptive identifiers and obscure arithmetic operations severely hinder comprehension despite correct syntax","tokens":743,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names in Portuguese (e.g. menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) which obscure intent. Herb/spice terms lack semantic meaning for the logic. No comments or context provided. The modulo arithmetic is unclear without domain knowledge. Enum ordinal usage is error-prone and hard to follow due to poor naming. Critical readability issues hinder comprehension","tokens":739,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related variable and method names (e.g. gengibre batata salsa) which obscure functionality. Despite correct syntax the complete lack of meaningful naming conventions makes purpose and logic impossible to discern without external context severely hindering readability and maintainability for any developer","tokens":857,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variable names (s d p n) making it extremely hard to understand their purpose Loops have complex logic without comments especially the digit manipulation for checksum calculation No meaningful separation of concerns or helper methods increases cognitive load The algorithm appears to calculate a check digit but lacks documentation or descriptive identifiers to clarify intent","tokens":1127,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis e métodos em português não descritivos (ex: coxa abobora feijaoVerde) relacionados a alimentos sem conexão com a lógica do código dificultando a compreensão mesmo para falantes nativos A estrutura básica está presente mas a falta de significado semântico nos identificadores torna a leitura extremamente confusa sem contexto adicional","tokens":1291,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and logically correct for calculating circle area but suffers from poor naming conventions Method calc is too vague and constant P should be named PI for clarity Using MathPI would improve precision and readability Despite these issues the simplicity of the logic aids comprehension","tokens":1088,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb names for methods and variables paprica alecrim menta which obscure intent despite correct syntax The logic involving modulo and negation lacks clarity without meaningful identifiers or comments violating standard naming conventions and severely hindering comprehension even for Portuguese speakers","tokens":1418,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear Portuguese method names like getEspinafre and getJaca which lack descriptive context making it hard to understand their purpose without domain knowledge despite correct ternary structure and final modifier usage","tokens":2002,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Method name \u0027calc\u0027 and single-letter variables \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 \u0027r\u0027 lack descriptive naming obscuring purpose Despite simple arithmetic poor identifiers hinder comprehension Adherence to naming conventions would improve readability Basic structure is clear but insufficient for higher score","tokens":2046,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
