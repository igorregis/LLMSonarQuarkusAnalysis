{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 and single-letter parameters \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive meaning making purpose unclear despite simple arithmetic logic short length and correct syntax insufficient context for comprehension without external knowledge","tokens":465,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers making logic hard to follow The mathematical operation lacks context comments and ordinal usage is unclear without enum context Poor naming conventions significantly hinder comprehension despite correct modulo arithmetic structure","tokens":686,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method and variable names are in Portuguese but lack semantic meaning related to their functionality tomilho thyme and pimentaCaiena cayenne pepper do not convey the purpose of returning a Month instance The logic using ordinal manipulation is obscure without context and violates naming best practices severely hindering readability and comprehension even for Portuguese speakers","tokens":714,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis e métodos em português não relacionados à funcionalidade (ex: abobora coxa feijaoVerde) dificultando a compreensão mesmo para falantes nativos A estrutura lógica existe mas a falta de significado semântico nos identificadores torna a leitura extremamente confusa além de possíveis erros como chamar nextFloat em variável int","tokens":1152,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Non-descriptive Portuguese method/variable names (paprica alecrim menta) violate Java conventions and obscure intent Magic number 12 lacks context Negative modulo operation is unclear No comments to explain logic Despite evaluator\u0027s language proficiency the identifiers fail to convey purpose making comprehension extremely difficult","tokens":885,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and logically correct for calculating circle area but suffers from poor naming conventions Method calc is too vague variables P and a lack descriptive names using single letters reduces clarity Hardcoded pi value instead of MathPI is acceptable but constant should be named PI for better readability Despite simplicity the naming issues moderately hinder comprehension","tokens":929,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese vegetable/herb names for variables and methods which obscures intent even for Portuguese speakers. Misuse of DoubleSummaryStatistics with custom fields like \u0027batata\u0027 instead of standard statistical terms creates confusion. Lack of meaningful命名 makes comprehension difficult despite simple structure","tokens":1196,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are unclear lacking descriptive context. The leap year logic is correct but obscured by poor naming. Redundant if-else structure reduces readability as it could directly return the boolean expression. Despite concise logic familiarity with leap year rules aids comprehension but insufficient for higher score due to maintainability concerns","tokens":1631,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code implements a check digit algorithm but suffers from poor variable names (p d s) lack of comments and complex loops Single-letter variables obscure purpose making comprehension difficult despite logical structure Array handling and string conversions add unnecessary complexity Essential context like dv dígito verificador is Portuguese-specific but insufficient for clarity","tokens":2984,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese use irrelevant food terms (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) failing to convey purpose; ternary logic is simple but obscured by poor naming; critical lack of descriptive identifiers lowers readability significantly despite language familiarity","tokens":3140,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
