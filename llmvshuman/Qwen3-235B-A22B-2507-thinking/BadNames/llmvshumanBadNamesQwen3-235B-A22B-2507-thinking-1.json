{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers making it extremely hard to understand the purpose Variables and methods lack semantic meaning obscuring the modulo-based month calculation logic No comments or context provided to clarify the obscure naming convention","tokens":719,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague and doesn\u0027t indicate it calculates circle area. Variables \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 lack descriptive naming though \u0027r\u0027 is acceptable for radius. Using hardcoded pi value instead of Math.PI reduces accuracy and clarity. Simple logic but poor naming choices hinder immediate comprehension despite short length","tokens":717,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese spice names (paprica menta alecrim) instead of meaningful identifiers making purpose unclear The modulo 12 operation suggests month handling but negative value passed to menta likely causes errors with Month enum which requires 1-12 No comments explain logic or handle edge cases severely hindering comprehension","tokens":716,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-English Portuguese names (tomilho pimentaCaiena) which obscure intent for international teams Magic numbers 3 lack explanation The ordinal manipulation logic is clever but poorly documented making it hard to grasp without context Variable names don\u0027t reflect domain meaning reducing readability significantly","tokens":707,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague and variables \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive names making purpose unclear despite simple arithmetic logic the absence of meaningful identifiers significantly hinders comprehension without additional context which is critical for maintainability and readability in professional codebases","tokens":723,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese plant names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) which obscure the method\u0027s purpose without domain context The ternary logic is concise but poor naming severely hinders comprehension as it fails to convey business meaning or calculation intent despite correct syntax and structure","tokens":1091,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses unclear single-letter variables p d s making purpose hard to grasp It implements a checksum algorithm likely Luhn but lacks descriptive names or comments Loops with multiple counters and string manipulations for digit sums reduce readability Complex logic without separation into methods increases cognitive load Error handling and edge cases like empty input are not evident","tokens":1506,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis e métodos em português não descritivos (ex: abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde) que não refletem suas finalidades dificultando a compreensão mesmo para falantes nativos A estrutura lógica existe porém a falta de clareza nas nomenclaturas e uso de termos aleatórios (alimentos) em vez de termos do domínio do problema prejudica severamente a legibilidade e manutenibilidade do código","tokens":1651,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and doesn\u0027t convey its purpose which is checking leap years The redundant if-else structure could be simplified to a direct boolean return Improving naming to \u0027isLeapYear\u0027 and removing unnecessary else would significantly enhance readability despite correct logic","tokens":1493,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related variable and method names (e.g. batata salsa abobora) which obscure their purpose. Despite simple structure the lack of meaningful identifiers makes comprehension extremely difficult even for Portuguese speakers as they don\u0027t reflect statistical operations being performed. Standard Java conventions for clarity are ignored","tokens":1651,"name":"Combine.java"}
