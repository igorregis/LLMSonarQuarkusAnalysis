{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague and doesn\u0027t indicate it calculates circle area. Using \u0027P\u0027 for pi is unclear though conventional; \u0027a\u0027 as variable name lacks meaning. Basic structure is simple but poor naming reduces readability. Better names like \u0027calculateCircleArea\u0027 and \u0027radius\u0027 would significantly improve comprehension despite correct mathematical logic","tokens":662,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (e.g., batata salsa abobora) which violate Java conventions and obscure meaning. Vegetable-themed identifiers lack semantic clarity despite correct syntax. Critical statistical operations (min/max/sum) are hidden behind irrelevant terms making intent incomprehensible without extensive reverse-engineering. Professional code requires self-documenting English identifiers for maintainability","tokens":749,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English Portuguese identifiers (paprica alecrim menta) violating Java naming conventions and obscuring intent Method names don\u0027t describe functionality parameters lack clarity Modulo 12 suggests month calculation but negative operation and herb-related terms create confusion No comments or context to explain logic making comprehension nearly impossible for international teams","tokens":684,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta oregano pimentaCaiena nozMoscada) instead of meaningful identifiers obscuring functionality The method\u0027s purpose (month calculation) is unclear due to poor naming conventions Magic numbers without explanation and lack of context for ordinal() further reduce comprehension Significant readability issues would require substantial reverse-engineering to understand","tokens":754,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks descriptive variable names (e.g. dv s d p) making purpose unclear. Complex nested operations in loops (e.g. n%2 ternary inside substring) reduce readability. No comments explain the algorithm (likely Luhn checksum). Array manipulation with null checks adds cognitive load. Logic is functional but requires deep tracing to understand flow and intent violating basic readability principles","tokens":1030,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027calc\u0027 and parameters \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive naming making the purpose unclear. Variable \u0027r\u0027 is ambiguous. Although logic is simple the poor naming conventions significantly hinder readability and maintainability without contextual comments","tokens":1012,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name isAB and parameter a lack descriptive meaning making purpose unclear; logic checks leap year but redundant if-else structure could be simplified to direct boolean return; correct algorithm but poor naming significantly hinders readability and comprehension without context","tokens":1011,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English non-descriptive names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 which obscure intent. The logic involving ordinal() manipulation lacks comments or meaningful identifiers making it extremely hard to comprehend without context. Violates naming conventions and readability best practices","tokens":1078,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis em português não descritivos (ex: abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde) que são termos aleatórios de alimentos sem relação com a funcionalidade prejudicando drasticamente a compreensão Mesmo para falantes de português a escolha dos nomes ignora convenções Java que recomendam termos em inglês e significativos A lógica estrutural é visível mas a falta de clareza nos identificadores torna a manutenção e entendimento extremamente difícil","tokens":1796,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is structurally concise with a clear ternary operation but suffers from non-descriptive Portuguese method names like getEspinafre and getJaca which obscure business logic intent Without domain context these names hinder comprehension despite correct syntax and structure adhering to basic Java conventions","tokens":2425,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
