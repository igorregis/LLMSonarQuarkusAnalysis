{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names in Portuguese (e.g. menta oregano pimentaCaiena) which obscure intent. Herb/spice-themed identifiers unrelated to functionality hinder comprehension. Lack of context for ordinal() and pimentaCaiena array increases cognitive load. Mathematical operations are simple but obscured by poor naming conventions making maintenance difficult for international teams","tokens":743,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses obscure non-descriptive variable and method names like \u0027paprica\u0027 \u0027alecrim\u0027 and \u0027menta\u0027 which are Portuguese plant names unrelated to date handling logic Month class usage is unclear without context The negative modulo operation lacks explanation making intent difficult to discern despite concise structure","tokens":792,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are non-descriptive Portuguese terms unrelated to functionality obscuring intent The logic using ordinal manipulation lacks comments making quarter-grouping behavior unclear despite syntactic correctness Poor naming conventions severely hinder comprehension even for Portuguese speakers","tokens":968,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Method and parameter names are non-descriptive (calc b a r) obscuring intent despite simple logic Meaningful names like calculateTriangleArea with base height would greatly improve readability and comprehension for maintainability","tokens":936,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese method names like getBrocolis and getEspinafre which are unclear without domain context. While the ternary structure is simple the non-descriptive identifiers obscure the logic\u0027s purpose making comprehension difficult despite correct syntax and structure","tokens":1180,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague; variables \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 lack clarity. Using magic number for pi instead of Math.PI. However short and straightforward logic partially offsets poor naming. Score reflects moderate readability due to naming issues despite simplicity","tokens":1224,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"O código utiliza nomes de variáveis e métodos em português não descritivos (ex: coxa abobora feijaoVerde) que não indicam propósito funcional prejudicando a compreensão mesmo para falantes nativos A ausência de significado semântico nos identificadores aliada a possíveis erros de lógica (int usado como objeto) torna a leitura extremamente difícil sem contexto adicional","tokens":1453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable and method names (e.g. batata salsa) which are Portuguese food terms severely hindering readability Despite simple structure lack of descriptive naming makes comprehension difficult even for Portuguese speakers in professional contexts where English is standard Score reflects poor naming conventions","tokens":1605,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and non-descriptive failing to convey its purpose as a leap year check Variable \u0027a\u0027 lacks meaning reducing readability The redundant if-else structure could be simplified to a direct boolean return improving conciseness While the leap year logic is correct poor naming conventions significantly hinder comprehension for maintainability and clarity","tokens":1667,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses obscure single-letter variables (p d s n) lacks comments and meaningful names making purpose unclear It implements a checksum algorithm likely Luhn but convoluted logic with string manipulations and non-intuitive loop indices hinders comprehension Significant effort needed to decipher functionality due to poor readability practices","tokens":2374,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
