{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese herb/spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers obscuring intent Magic numbers lack context and ordinal usage assumes enum knowledge without comments making logic hard to follow despite correct modulo arithmetic for month calculation","tokens":684,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name isAB is unclear; variable \u0027a\u0027 lacks meaning. Logic checks leap year but uses non-descriptive identifiers. Redundant if-else structure could be simplified to direct boolean return. Improved naming like isLeapYear and \u0027year\u0027 variable would enhance readability significantly. Core logic is correct but comprehension requires domain knowledge","tokens":707,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Método e parâmetros com nomes em português não descritivos (paprica alecrim menta) que não indicam propósito lógico Uso de operações matemáticas obscuras sem contexto ou comentários Dificuldade extrema em associar nomes de especiarias ao comportamento de manipulação de meses Compromete totalmente a compreensão mesmo para falantes nativos devido à falta de semântica clara","tokens":728,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method and parameter names are non-descriptive (e.g. \u0027calc\u0027 \u0027a\u0027 \u0027b\u0027) obscuring purpose; however the logic is straightforward and concise making basic comprehension achievable despite poor naming conventions which significantly hinder readability and maintainability in larger contexts","tokens":960,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple but suffers from poor naming conventions: \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague \u0027P\u0027 should be \u0027PI\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 should be \u0027area\u0027. Using descriptive names would significantly improve readability. The logic is straightforward but unclear intent reduces comprehension for maintainability","tokens":1260,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variables and method names use irrelevant Portuguese food terms (e.g. abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde) obscuring purpose. Method coxa lacks semantic meaning. Critical type confusion: int feijaoVerde used with nextFloat(). No comments or context to explain logic. Structure exists but extreme naming obscurity hinders comprehension even for Portuguese speakers unfamiliar with domain-specific metaphors","tokens":1496,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use irrelevant Portuguese herb names obscuring intent. The logic (ordinal/3)*3 suggests quarter-start month calculation but lacks descriptive naming or comments. Non-intuitive arithmetic and absence of context make comprehension difficult requiring reverse-engineering of obscure identifiers","tokens":1297,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Uses non-descriptive Portuguese food-related identifiers instead of meaningful names misuses DoubleSummaryStatistics as a custom class causing confusion lacks context for field purposes and violates standard Java naming conventions which impedes comprehension despite simple structure","tokens":1514,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Non-descriptive Portuguese method names like getBrocolis and getEspinafre obscure purpose despite simple ternary logic Industry standards favor English and meaningful identifiers for clarity Even for Portuguese speakers the vegetable-based names mislead about actual functionality reducing maintainability and comprehension","tokens":1618,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Poor variable names (s d p) and unclear method name dv hinder understanding Loops with non-intuitive indices and lack of comments make algorithm hard to follow despite correct logic for check digit calculation String operations instead of integer math add unnecessary complexity Requires deep analysis to grasp purpose","tokens":2169,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
