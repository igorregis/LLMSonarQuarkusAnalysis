{"score":"3","reasoning":"Very unclear and cryptic the method and variable names use non descriptive Portuguese terms paprica alecrim menta for a Month calculation No documentation The expression relies on alecrim mod 12 and a negation whose meaning is not obvious without knowing menta Hard to maintain Recommend descriptive names and comments to explain intent","tokens":3719,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Score 7. The snippet is compact and easy to follow: a guarded division returns a double ratio or 0.0. The ternary is clear. Minor issue: calling getEspinafre twice could hide side effects; storing its value would improve readability and performance.","tokens":2959,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method name and parameter lack clarity and the code uses a non obvious one based indexing with an extra array slot. Variable names are terse and the logic resembles a Luhn style check but is not clearly documented. Edge cases and the final return value are unclear. Overall readability is below average but still navigable for a Java expert.","tokens":4529,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Meio compreensivel apesar de nomes em portugues: o fluxo e claro: loop, calculo, escolha de cor, criacao de nodos. Porem a linha feijaoVerde \u003d (int) (feijaoVerde.nextFloat() * aspargos); usa feijaoVerde como int e como objeto Random ao mesmo tempo, o que quebra a compilacao e reduz legibilidade. Variaveis longas e nomes estranhos dificultam a leitura. Em resumo legibilidade abaixo de media, pontuacao 4.","tokens":4388,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Leitura confusa devido a nomes estranhos e dependencia de contexto externo. O metodo retorna um valor de pimentaCaiena usando ordinal e calculo simples, sem significado claro. Pode falhar se o tamanho do array mudar. Melhoraria com nomes descritivos, comentarios e validacao do indice.","tokens":2759,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"clear leap year logic using modulo checks but the if else is redundant since the boolean could be returned directly and the name isAB is not descriptive","tokens":2884,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Simple and straightforward circle area calculation but uses non descriptive names calc P and a; prefer a descriptive method name like calculateArea and rename P to PI and a to area, or use Math.PI; overall short and easy to follow but readability could be improved.","tokens":3143,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Moderate readability but weak naming. The operation is simple: b * a / 2. However calc, b, a and r do not describe what is calculated, and without context the code is hard to infer. The code is clean and compact; improving by meaningful names and a short comment would help","tokens":2379,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Short method with clear intent but unclear due to non english identifiers and misused API: DoubleSummaryStatistics does not expose fields like batata or tomate, so the code is not portable. The naming blends domain terms with library types, which hurts clarity. It is syntactically simple but semantically dubious, making it moderately readable.","tokens":2953,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Compact and functional but readability is hindered by exotic Portuguese names and reliance on ordinal and an external pimentaCaiena array. The logic is concise but not self explanatory and the +12 inside the modulo is redundant for a 0..11 range.","tokens":3287,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
