{"score":"3","reasoning":"Readability is very poor due to cryptic identifiers paprica alecrim menta and lack of documentation. The expression return menta(-(alecrim % 12)) is unclear and could be invalid for positive inputs since menta may not accept negative values or zero for a Month. Without knowing menta, the semantics are opaque. Overall difficult to understand.","tokens":4177,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Clear and compact use of ternary to guard division and return a double. Easy to read. A caveat: if getJaca and getEspinafre return ints, the division may be integer before converting to double, reducing precision. Mixed Portuguese/English names can also hinder readability for some. Consider (double) getJaca() / getEspinafre() or ensure operands are doubles.","tokens":2599,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Obscure and brittle due to heavy index based loops and mixing strings with numbers; poor naming and no comments; potential null input and edge cases; returns 10 for empty input which is odd; overall readability is low.","tokens":5338,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code readability is low due to cryptic Portuguese variable names and lack of comments. The purpose is unclear and the mix of languages hurts comprehension. There is a likely bug: feijaoVerde is an int but is used as if it were a Random with nextFloat(), and other identifiers like MILHOS, aspargos, aipo are not defined in the snippet, reducing clarity.","tokens":3777,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Baixa legibilidade devido a nomes nao descritivos como tomilho e pimentaCaiena e a logica de selecionar o indice com (ordinal()/3)*3 sem contexto claro; o objetivo nao fica obvio","tokens":4278,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Correct leap year logic; method name isAB is unclear and the if else is redundant; could be simplified to return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0) to improve clarity","tokens":2525,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Readability is moderate. It clearly computes pi*r^2 but uses short names and a non conventional constant P. Better to name the constant PI, the parameter radius, and the result area; and use Math.PI. The method name calc is generic; overall easy to follow for basic math but could be improved with descriptive identifiers.","tokens":1814,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"score seven because the code is short and easy to read the formula is clear yet the parameter names b and a and the local name r are not descriptive and there is no comment or documentation","tokens":3124,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is short but misleading because it uses DoubleSummaryStatistics as if it had fields like batata, salsa, tomate, pepino, alecrim and berinjela; these fields do not exist in the API, hurting correctness and readability. The Portuguese identifiers also hinder comprehension for non Portuguese readers.","tokens":3715,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Score razoavel. O codigo usa nomes em portugues que pode dificultar a leitura para quem nao conhece o tema e a logica depende de ordinal, modulo 12 e offset com 12. A expressao e compacta e pode gerar duvida sobre o funcionamento sem comentarios. Nomes mais descritivos melhorariam a clareza.","tokens":4459,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
