{"score":"4","reasoning":"Readability is low due to non descriptive identifiers paprica alecrim menta and unclear intent; the expression uses a long modulo 12 and a unary minus which can be confusing especially for negative inputs; without more context it is hard to deduce what menta does; improve with descriptive names and a clarifying comment","tokens":3464,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise and readable due to a simple ternary that returns a ratio or 0.0. However the Portuguese method names may reduce readability for non speakers. If getJaca and getEspinafre return int, division is integer before being converted to double. 0.0d is unconventional; an explicit cast to double would improve clarity.","tokens":3422,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Hard to read due to non idiomatic 1 based indexing on a String array and cryptic loop structure; no comments; uses string based numeric ops; potential off by one and the final 10 result when sum is multiple of 10; overall readability is average but not beginner friendly.","tokens":7207,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The loop and object creation are easy to follow, but readability is hindered by inconsistent types and long Portuguese names. The line feijaoVerde \u003d (int) (feijaoVerde.nextFloat() * aspargos) would not compile since feijaoVerde is an int, not a random generator, which undermines trust in the code. The canDisplayUpTo check and the null handling are also unclear.","tokens":4108,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Moderate to low readability. The one line uses ordinal() to compute an index ((ordinal()/3)*3) and returns from pimentaCaiena, which is cryptic without knowing the enum order and array type. Portuguese names reduce readability in mixed code bases. Clearer naming and a named constant for the 3 offset would help.","tokens":4110,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Is a standard leap year check. The boolean expression is clear and the method returns a boolean directly, but the else is redundant and the parameter and method name are not descriptive. Could simplify to return ((a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0)); and rename to isLeapYear(int year).","tokens":2868,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple and readable snippet that computes circle area as pi times radius squared. It uses a local final constant P which is acceptable but not ideal; using Math.PI and a descriptive name would improve clarity. Overall easy to understand.","tokens":2432,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Codigo simples e direto, facil de entender para quem conhece Java; pontos de melhoria: nomes de parametros (b, a) e da variavel (r) pouco descritivos e sem comentarios; com nomes mais claros e explicitar o funcionamento melhora a legibilidade","tokens":3587,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Nomes em portugues ajudam a legibilidade para quem conhece o dominio, o metodo eh curto e soma valores e atualiza min e max. No entanto pimenta eh do tipo DoubleSummaryStatistics com campos batata, salsa, etc nao parecem da API padrao, o que dificulta entender sem contexto. Comentarios ou nomes mais descritivos melhorariam.","tokens":6226,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The method is short and consistent but relies on external context (pimentaCaiena array and ordinal() from an enum) which may not be clear to readers. The names menta nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena are playful but not self explanatory. The negative input is handled by adding 12, which is clever but subtle.","tokens":5613,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
