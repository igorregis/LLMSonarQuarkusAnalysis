{"score":"3","reasoning":"Very cryptic due to non descriptive names paprica alecrim menta; a one line method that delegates to menta with a negative modulo 12, making intent unclear without knowing what menta does. Readability is low and comprehension requires more context.","tokens":2749,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear compact expression that guards division by zero with a ternary and returns a double. However if getJaca and getEspinafre return int, the division is integer before widening, so decimals are lost. Portuguese names may hinder readability for non Portuguese teams. Overall readable but with a potential bug and language specificity.","tokens":3095,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Score 4: readability is low due to cryptic names dv p d and many loops, plus using a string array to hold numbers instead of simple ints. The logic resembles Luhn but final 10 - s % 10 is fragile and indexing could fail. Overall hard to read and maintain.","tokens":4138,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Pontuacao baixa por nomes confusos e por um erro de compilacao evidente: feijaoVerde declarado como int e usado como objeto com nextFloat, logo o trecho nao compila. A mistura de portugues com termos inventados reduz a legibilidade, embora o fluxo seja simples (criacao de DadosAmostra e DynamicTreeNode em um loop).","tokens":5051,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic names tomilho and pimentaCaiena and the use of ordinal() to index an array. Without context or comments the intent is unclear and prone to errors; improve by using descriptive names, explicit mapping, and documentation.","tokens":3067,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Clear leap year logic using modulo. The boolean expression is readable. However the name isAB is vague and reduces clarity. Also the if else is redundant since it returns the condition directly; could be simplified to return ((a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0));","tokens":2413,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear and correct circle area calculation using r. However the local names P and a are not descriptive and could be improved with Math.PI and a more meaningful area variable. The snippet is short and easy to follow, but readability would improve with better naming.","tokens":2245,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"6. The code is concise and correct for computing (b*a)/2 with doubles. Readability is limited by vague names calc and a/b, and no documentation. The local variable r adds noise; could simplify to return (b*a)/2; and rename parameters to base and height or at least describe the intent.","tokens":4112,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The culinary themed names are evocative but using DoubleSummaryStatistics as the type for pimenta clashes with the field accesses like pimenta.batata. The arithmetic updates and Math.min/Math.max are straightforward. Without full class context this may confuse a reader. Overall readable but the naming and type choices could be improved for clarity.","tokens":3021,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Compact modulo based mapping to Month but the code relies on ordinal inside an enum and an external array pimentaCaiena; with Portuguese names and no comments the readability is moderate and context dependent.","tokens":5707,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
