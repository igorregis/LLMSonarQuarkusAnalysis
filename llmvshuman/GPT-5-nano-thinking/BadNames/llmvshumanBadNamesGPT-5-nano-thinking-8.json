{"score":"3","reasoning":"Very short but the intent is unclear due to non descriptive names paprica alecrim menta; The expression negative of alecrim mod 12 and the call to menta obscure how months are computed; No comments or docs; Readability is low and you need more context to understand","tokens":3843,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The ternary keeps it compact and guards division. However if getJaca and getEspinafre return integers, the division may be integer division and lose precision when the result is promoted to double. The code relies on Portuguese names which may hinder non Portuguese readers. A cast to double or ensuring the operands are doubles would improve clarity.","tokens":3746,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Moderate to low readability due to complex index based loops and the unusual use of a string array to hold numeric parts. The method name dv is not descriptive and there is no null check for p. The final expression 10 - s%10 can return 10 instead of 0 when the sum is a multiple of 10, indicating a subtle bug. Overall confusing but understandable.","tokens":2873,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Codigo com legibilidade baixa: nomes em portugues pouco descritivos, variaveis confusas e um possivel erro de compilacao ao chamar nextFloat numa variavel do tipo int. A logica e facil de seguir ate certo ponto: cria dados, atribui cor por paridade, envolve em um no arvore e marca o flag. Nomes elevam a confusao reduzindo a clareza","tokens":7044,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Score 4: the snippet is compact but not very readable. The names tomilho and pimentaCaiena are unclear and the intent of ordinal() / 3 is not obvious without context. It uses a magic number 3 and a potentially opaque array lookup. A clearer version would rename the variables to reflect purpose, extract the calculation, and add comments or constants.","tokens":3796,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The logic correctly implements the leap year rule. Readability is decent but the name isAB is cryptic and the if/else is unnecessarily verbose; replacing with a direct return and a descriptive name like isLeapYear(year) would improve clarity.","tokens":1689,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Readable basic circle area calculation. Uses a local final constant P instead of Math.PI, and variable a is not descriptive. Method name calc is generic. A clearer version would use PI or Math.PI and rename a to area; overall comprehension is good with minor style improvements.","tokens":2122,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The computation is correct and concise but the name calc and the parameter names b and a are not descriptive. The local variable r is unnecessary; could return (b*a)/2 directly. Rename to base and height (or area) for clearer intent.","tokens":2501,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"codigo pouco claro pois o parametro eh DoubleSummaryStatistics e o trecho usa campos como batata salsa tomate pepino alecrim berinjela que nao existem na API padrao; sem contexto fica dificil entender a intencao e pode nao compilar","tokens":4280,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The function is short and uses a simple 0-11 offset to pick a Month from pimentaCaiena. The exotic Portuguese names lowers clarity and requires context about the Month enum and the pimentaCaiena array. The call to ordinal() suggests this is inside an enum, which limits portability outside that context.","tokens":4967,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
