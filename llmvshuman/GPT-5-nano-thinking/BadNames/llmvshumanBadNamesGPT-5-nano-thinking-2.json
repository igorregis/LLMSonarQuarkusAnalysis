{"score":"4","reasoning":"Short and compact but names are opaque (paprica, alecrim, menta) making intent hard to infer. It depends on an external method menta and a Month return type without context. The expression -(alecrim % 12) is clear, but its meaning for negative inputs depends on menta. Overall readability is low.","tokens":2573,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a clear ternary to guard division and return a double. It is fairly readable. Potential issues: if getJaca and getEspinafre return int, the division is integer division and may truncate results; also getEspinafre is evaluated twice. Casting to double or caching values would improve clarity.","tokens":4699,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Codigo com leitura de dificuldade devido a nomes de variaveis pouco descriptivos e loops complexos. O algoritmo lembra o Luhn, mas sem comentarios e com indexacao confusa. O retorno final 10 - s % 10 pode ser incorreto quando s%10 \u003d\u003d 0 e entradas vazias ou nulas podem produzir resultados inesperados.","tokens":4532,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Codigo de leitura ruim por nomes em portugues nao padronizados e variaveis confusas; a expressao de geracao de feijaoVerde usa feijaoVerde.nextFloat quando feijaoVerde e inteiro, o que e um bug de compilacao; sem comentarios a logica do loop fica obscura; a atribuicao de alhoPoro e trechos de construcao de DadosAmostra dificultam entendimento","tokens":3467,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Moderate readability. The method is concise but relies on ordinal() and a not obvious index formula (ordinal()/3)*3 to pick from pimentaCaiena. Without knowing what pimentaCaiena holds or how tomilho is used, the intent is unclear. Names are domain specific which hurts clarity for mixed teams. Overall understandable but not self documenting.","tokens":4049,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Readable leap year check with correct logic. The if/else is redundant because the return value is already a boolean. Consider simplifying to return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0); and rename a to year and isAB to isLeapYear for clarity.","tokens":2156,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Very readable simple method that computes circle area from radius r. Minor style issues: the name calc is not descriptive and the constant P would typically be a class level PI and static final; the temporary variable a could be named area or the expression returned directly. Overall clear and easy to follow.","tokens":2381,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Score 6: the code is syntactically correct and easy to read but the purpose is unclear due to generic parameter and variable names and the method name calc. Using meaningful names and inlining the return would improve readability","tokens":2619,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Score 4: The code is short and readable with simple arithmetic and a couple of calls. However it references fields like batata, salsa, tomate, pepino on DoubleSummaryStatistics which do not exist in standard Java, making it semantically invalid. The intent to update totals and min/max from pimenta is clear, but missing context and non standard field usage hurts comprehension.","tokens":4371,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Readable but cryptic. It uses ordinal and a pimentaCaiena array to map to a Month, but the surrounding enum type and array are not shown. The Portuguese names reduce accessibility for non Portuguese readers. The modulo arithmetic with (oregano + 12) is clever but unclear without comments. Overall readability is moderate to low.","tokens":3622,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
