{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and logical flow. The mathematical operations and method calls are straightforward to follow. Minor complexity in compensation logic but overall good comprehension level.","tokens":275,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with clear ternary operator logic for calculating average. Well-named method and variables make purpose obvious. Minor improvement could be extracting the zero check into a named constant for better readability.","tokens":248,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and functional but lacks clarity in the arithmetic logic. The modulo operations and offset calculations make it harder to immediately grasp the intent. Missing documentation or comments to explain the enum-based month arithmetic reduces readability for developers unfamiliar with this pattern.","tokens":265,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is reasonably readable with clear variable names and logical flow but could benefit from additional comments and better separation of concerns. The method does multiple things (random selection, font validation, node creation) without clear documentation. Some magic numbers and tight coupling between components reduce maintainability.","tokens":464,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Codigo bem estruturado com nome de metodo descritivo em portugues que indica claramente a funcao. Parametros claros e logicamente nomeados. Formula matematica simples e direta para calculo de area de triangulo. Boa legibilidade geral e facil compreensao da logica implementada.","tokens":282,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear intent. Uses meaningful method names and handles modulo operation properly. Minor improvement could be adding parameter validation and documentation comments for better maintainability and clarity","tokens":231,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method name in Portuguese, descriptive variable names, proper use of final keyword for constant, and straightforward calculation logic. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI for better precision","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear naming conventions with \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 indicating purpose. Logic is straightforward using ordinal division and multiplication to find quarter start month. Minimal complexity and good use of enum ordinal functionality makes it easily comprehensible.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to unclear variable names like \u0027numeros\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027, complex nested operations, and lack of comments. The logic is hard to follow without domain knowledge. Multiple loops with similar structures increase cognitive load. Method name is not descriptive enough for its specific purpose.","tokens":496,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is functionally correct and implements the leap year logic properly using clear mathematical conditions. The method name is descriptive in Portuguese (isAnoBissexto means isLeapYear). However the readability could be improved by simplifying the return statement to directly return the boolean expression instead of using an if-else block. The logic is straightforward but the nested conditions make it slightly complex to read at first glance.","tokens":321,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
