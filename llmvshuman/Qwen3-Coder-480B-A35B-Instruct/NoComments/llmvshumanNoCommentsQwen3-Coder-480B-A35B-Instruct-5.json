{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is reasonably readable with clear variable names and logical flow but lacks comments and has some complex conditional logic that could be simplified. The method performs multiple operations without clear separation of concerns.","tokens":446,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names in Portuguese. Simple logic and good structure. Minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value","tokens":247,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear intent. Uses modular arithmetic to handle month subtraction efficiently. Method naming is in Portuguese but follows logical convention. Negative value handling is implicit but correct. Minor improvement could be adding parameter validation or documentation.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with clear ternary operator logic for calculating average. Well-named method and variables make intent obvious. Minor improvement could be extracting the zero check into a named constant for better readability.","tokens":248,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and logical flow. The mathematical operations and method calls are straightforward to follow. Minor complexity comes from the compensation logic but overall maintains good comprehensibility for experienced Java developers.","tokens":283,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable and implements the leap year logic correctly using clear conditional statements. The method name is descriptive and follows Java conventions. However, the logic could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of using an if-else block, which would improve conciseness without sacrificing readability.","tokens":296,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is moderately readable but lacks clarity in the arithmetic logic. The modulo operation with 12 and the addition of 12 before another modulo is confusing. Variable naming could be more descriptive. However the core functionality of adding months is understandable and the enum array access pattern is clear.","tokens":274,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Codigo dificil de ler devido a nomes de variaveis pouco descritivos como \u0027n\u0027 e \u0027numeros\u0027 sendo usado para armazenar strings em vez de numeros. Logica complexa com multiplos loops aninhados e operacoes matematicas obscuras. Falta de comentarios e estrutura confusa tornam a compreensao dificil mesmo para programadores experientes","tokens":523,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear naming conventions with \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 indicating purpose. Logic is straightforward using ordinal division. Minor improvement could be adding comments for clarity","tokens":237,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Codigo bem estruturado com nome de metodo descritivo em portugues que indica claramente a funcao. Parametros claros e logicos. Formula matematica simples e direta. Boa legibilidade geral e facil compreensao mesmo para desenvolvedores junior. Poderia melhorar com comentarios explicativos sobre os parametros e retorno.","tokens":288,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
