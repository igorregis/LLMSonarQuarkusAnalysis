{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is reasonably readable with clear variable names and logical flow but lacks comments and has some complex conditional logic that could be simplified for better maintainability","tokens":438,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear naming conventions with \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 indicating purpose. Logic is straightforward using ordinal division and multiplication to find quarter start month. Minimal complexity and good use of enum ordinal method makes it readable.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code implements a checksum calculation but lacks clarity due to poor variable naming, complex nested operations, and missing comments. The logic is hard to follow without domain knowledge. Structure could be improved with better formatting and explanatory variables.","tokens":483,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable and implements the leap year logic correctly using clear conditional statements. The method name is descriptive and follows Java conventions. However, the logic could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of using an if-else block, and adding comments would improve maintainability.","tokens":294,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is moderately readable but lacks clarity in the arithmetic logic. The modulo operation with 12 and the addition of 12 before another modulo is confusing. Variable naming could be more descriptive. However the core functionality of adding months is understandable and the enum array access pattern is clear.","tokens":274,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method name in Portuguese describing triangle area calculation. Simple logic with descriptive variable names. Minor improvement could be adding documentation comments.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear intent. Uses modular arithmetic to handle month subtraction efficiently. Only minor improvement would be adding input validation and documentation comments for better maintainability and clarity","tokens":231,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and logical flow. The method combines statistics by updating count, sum, compensation, min, and max values appropriately. Only minor improvements could be made with additional comments for clarity.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clean and readable with proper naming conventions. The ternary operator is used appropriately for simple conditional logic. Method names are descriptive and follow Java standards. Only minor improvement would be extracting the condition to a separate variable for better readability.","tokens":255,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Codigo bem estruturado com nomes significativos em portugues tornando a leitura intuitiva para falantes da lingua. Logica simples e direta para calculo de area de circulo. Ponto negativo e o uso de constante local em vez de Math.PI o que reduz precisao e nao segue boas praticas.","tokens":293,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
