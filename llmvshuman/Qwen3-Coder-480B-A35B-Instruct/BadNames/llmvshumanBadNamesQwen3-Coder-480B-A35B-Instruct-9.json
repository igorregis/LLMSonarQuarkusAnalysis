{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and straightforward with clear variable names and simple mathematical operation. Minor improvements could include more descriptive method name and parameter name, but overall comprehension is good.","tokens":244,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic variable names (p d s), complex nested operations, lack of comments, and convoluted logic flow. The purpose is unclear without domain knowledge. Multiple operations per line reduce maintainability.","tokens":465,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. Well-structured conditional with proper indentation. Could be slightly improved by removing redundant else clause and directly returning the boolean expression result.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable names like nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena which obscure the actual logic. The method name Month menta doesnt clearly indicate purpose. While the arithmetic logic works the obfuscated naming makes comprehension extremely difficult for maintenance purposes","tokens":289,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic uses array indexing with ordinal division that\u0027s hard to understand without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. The purpose of returning every third month starting from index 0 is not obvious from the code structure.","tokens":266,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, etc.), unclear method name (coxa), missing variable declarations (feijaoVerde.nextFloat(), aspargos, aipo, MILHOS), and lack of comments or documentation. Logic is hard to follow and maintain.","tokens":505,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable but uses unclear method names like getBrocolis getEspinafre and getJaca which make comprehension difficult despite the simple ternary logic structure","tokens":245,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and concise with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Simple method with single responsibility.","tokens":236,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless variable names (alecrim menta paprica) that dont follow Java naming conventions making it hard to understand the purpose Function name suggests it returns Month but logic is unclear without context Very poor naming choices make comprehension extremely difficult","tokens":250,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to understand due to meaningless method and variable names in Portuguese that don\u0027t follow Java conventions. Method name gengibre and parameters like pimenta batata salsa provide no semantic meaning. While structure is clear the naming makes maintenance and comprehension very challenging","tokens":325,"name":"Combine.java"}
