{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming (p d s n), complex nested operations without clear purpose, magic numbers, convoluted logic flow with multiple transformations, lacks documentation or comments, difficult to understand algorithm intent","tokens":459,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless method and variable names (paprica menta alecrim) that provide no semantic context Also lacks proper documentation and uses cryptic arithmetic operations without clear purpose","tokens":238,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to understand due to meaningless variable names (batata, pimenta, salsa, etc.) that obscure the actual logic. While the mathematical operations are clear, the purpose and meaning of the variables and method are completely unclear, making maintenance and comprehension challenging for other developers","tokens":329,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic using ordinal division and array indexing is confusing without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. No comments or documentation to explain the purpose. The code is hard to understand and maintain.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde), lack of comments, and unclear logic flow. The purpose of the method and its operations are difficult to understand without domain knowledge. Variable names like inhame, alcachofra make maintenance challenging","tokens":501,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable and implements leap year logic correctly The method name could be more descriptive like isLeapYear but the logic is clear and well structured with proper indentation and straightforward conditional statements","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements could be made with more descriptive method name and parameter.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context Making it extremely difficult to understand the business logic or purpose of this calculation without additional documentation","tokens":254,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is hard to read due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) that obscure the logic. The method name menta and parameter naming make it difficult to understand the purpose. While the arithmetic logic works the obfuscated naming convention severely impacts readability and maintainability","tokens":294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
