{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and straightforward with clear variable names and logical flow. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements needed for constant naming convention and documentation.","tokens":244,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic using ordinal() and array indexing is confusing without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. Code lacks documentation and readability","tokens":248,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logically correct for leap year calculation. The method name isAB is unclear but the logic is sound. Could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of using if-else structure. Good use of parentheses for clarity.","tokens":281,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method names (getBrocolis getEspinafre getJaca) that dont convey business logic or purpose Method names should be descriptive and follow Java naming conventions Code is technically correct but extremely difficult to understand and maintain","tokens":261,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde), lack of comments, unclear logic flow, and references to undefined variables (aspargos, aipo, MILHOS). The method name coxa() is also unclear. However, basic structure is present.","tokens":505,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"O código possui nomes de variáveis muito curtos e pouco descritivos (p, s, d, i, n), tornando difícil entender a intenção do algoritmo. A lógica é complexa e não documentada, com múltiplos loops aninhados que manipulam um array de strings de forma confusa. Não há comentários ou documentação para explicar o propósito do método ou a lógica implementada. A estrutura geral é difícil de seguir e manter.","tokens":528,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to read due to meaningless variable names (alecrim) and unclear method names (paprica menta). The logic is simple but obfuscated by poor naming conventions. No comments or documentation provided. Structure is basic but comprehension requires significant mental effort to understand intent.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) that obscure the actual logic. The method name menta() and parameter names make it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. While the arithmetic logic itself is sound the obfuscated naming makes comprehension very challenging. Missing context about what this method should do. Poor naming conventions severely impact readability.","tokens":312,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code uses meaningless variable names (pimenta, batata, salsa) that obscure the actual functionality. Method names like abobora and alecrim provide no semantic meaning. While the structure follows Java conventions, the lack of clear naming makes the purpose and logic extremely difficult to understand. No comments or documentation exist to clarify the intent. The code appears to perform some statistical operations but is nearly incomprehensible due to poor naming choices.","tokens":361,"name":"Combine.java"}
