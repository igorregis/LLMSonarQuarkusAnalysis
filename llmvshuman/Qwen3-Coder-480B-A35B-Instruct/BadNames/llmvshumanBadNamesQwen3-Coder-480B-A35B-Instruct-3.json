{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements could be made like using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value and more descriptive method name.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. Well-structured conditional statement with proper indentation. Could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of using if-else block. Variable name \u0027a\u0027 is not very descriptive but acceptable for simple method.","tokens":286,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming (s, d, p, n) makes code hard to understand. Complex nested operations without clear purpose. Missing comments or documentation. Logic is convoluted with multiple transformations that are not immediately clear. The method name \u0027dv\u0027 is not descriptive enough to understand its purpose","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic using array indexing with ordinal division is confusing without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. No comments or documentation to explain the purpose. The code is functional but hard to understand and maintain.","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is hard to read due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) that obscure the logic. The method name Month suggests enum usage but implementation is unclear. Magic numbers like 12 without context. No comments or documentation to explain purpose. Logic appears to be date manipulation but is difficult to comprehend.","tokens":303,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, etc.), undefined variables (feijaoVerde.nextFloat(), aspargos, aipo, MILHOS), lack of comments, and unclear logic flow. The method name coxa() is also non-descriptive. High cognitive load required to understand purpose and functionality.","tokens":513,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable and method names (paprica menta alecrim) that provide no semantic context. The negative modulo operation lacks documentation. While the logic is simple the obfuscated naming makes comprehension difficult","tokens":245,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context. The ternary operator logic is simple but the cryptic naming makes comprehension difficult. No comments or documentation to clarify intent. While functionally correct the code is not maintainable or self-documenting.","tokens":277,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to understand due to meaningless variable names (batata, salsa, abobora, etc.) that don\u0027t convey purpose. Method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and parameter \u0027pimenta\u0027 are also unclear. No comments or documentation explaining what this method does. However, the logic itself is straightforward arithmetic operations and method calls.","tokens":342,"name":"Combine.java"}
