{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano) and unclear method name (menta) that make code purpose difficult to understand","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless variable names (paprica alecrim menta) that dont follow Java naming conventions and lack semantic meaning making comprehension very difficult","tokens":232,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. The method name could be more descriptive and the if-else structure could be simplified to a single return statement but overall comprehension is good.","tokens":272,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, etc.), unclear method purpose, magic numbers, and lack of comments. Logic is hard to follow without context about class fields and methods. Some structure exists but overall comprehension is very difficult.","tokens":494,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to understand due to meaningless variable names (batata, salsa, abobora, etc.) that obscure the actual logic. While the mathematical operations are clear, the purpose and meaning of the variables and method are completely unclear, making maintenance and comprehension extremely challenging.","tokens":328,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The expression (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is confusing without context. Variable pimentaCaiena is not descriptive. No comments or documentation to explain the logic. Poor readability due to cryptic names and unclear mathematical operation purpose.","tokens":267,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements could be made with more descriptive method name and parameter naming.","tokens":250,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context Making it extremely difficult to understand the business logic or purpose of this calculation without additional documentation","tokens":254,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and concise with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Simple method with single responsibility.","tokens":236,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic variable names (p d s n), complex nested operations, lack of comments, and convoluted logic flow. The method performs mathematical operations on string digits but the purpose and algorithm are unclear without domain knowledge. Variable names should be descriptive and the logic should be broken into smaller, well-named methods.","tokens":488,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
