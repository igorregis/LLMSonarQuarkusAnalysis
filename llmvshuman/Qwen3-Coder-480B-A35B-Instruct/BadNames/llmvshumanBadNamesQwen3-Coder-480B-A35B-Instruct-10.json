{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and straightforward with clear variable names and simple mathematical operation. Minor improvements could include more descriptive method name and parameter name, but overall comprehension is good.","tokens":244,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming (p d s n), complex nested operations without clear purpose, magic numbers, convoluted logic flow with multiple transformations, lacks documentation or comments, difficult to understand algorithm intent","tokens":459,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless variable names (paprica alecrim menta) that dont follow Java conventions Methods and variables should use descriptive names in English to improve comprehension The logic is simple but obfuscated by poor naming","tokens":246,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. The method name could be more descriptive (isLeapYear instead of isAB) and the nested conditions could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression without if-else block.","tokens":280,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates triangle area using base and height. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names like \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027 instead of \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless variable names (batata salsa abobora etc) that make no logical sense. Method name gengibre and parameter pimenta are also unclear. The operations performed are obscured by these poor naming choices making comprehension very difficult","tokens":325,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable names like nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena which obscure the actual logic. The method name Month menta suggests poor naming conventions. While the modulo arithmetic works the obfuscated names make comprehension extremely difficult even for experienced developers","tokens":290,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic using array indexing with ordinal division is confusing without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. No comments or documentation to explain the purpose. The code is functional but hard to understand and maintain.","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context. The ternary operator logic is simple but the cryptic naming makes comprehension difficult. No comments or documentation to clarify intent. Code structure is clean but naming conventions severely impact maintainability and understanding.","tokens":276,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, etc.), lacks proper documentation, uses magic numbers, has unclear logic flow, and contains undeclared variables (aipo, aspargos, MILHOS). The method name \u0027coxa\u0027 is also non-descriptive. However, the basic structure and some naming conventions follow Java standards.","tokens":522,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
