{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano) and unclear method name (menta) that make code purpose difficult to understand","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area result) but functionality is easily understood. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity.","tokens":240,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is hard to read due to meaningless variable names (paprica alecrim menta) that dont follow Java naming conventions making it difficult to understand the methods purpose or logic flow","tokens":236,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic variable names (p d s), complex nested operations, unclear algorithm purpose, and lack of comments or documentation to explain the business logic","tokens":453,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to understand due to meaningless method and variable names in Portuguese that don\u0027t follow Java conventions. The logic is obscured by poor naming choices like gengibre pimenta batata making it hard to comprehend the actual functionality and purpose of this method.","tokens":325,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and well-structured with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements could be using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value and more descriptive method name like calculateCircleArea","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The expression uses magic numbers (3) without explanation. Array access logic is not immediately obvious. Poor variable names and lack of comments make comprehension difficult.","tokens":247,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names that provide no semantic context. The single-letter method names make code comprehension extremely difficult. While the ternary logic is syntactically correct it lacks clarity. No comments or documentation to explain the business logic. The code structure is simple but entirely opaque in meaning.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde), lack of comments, unclear logic flow, and undefined variables (aspargos, aipo, MILHOS). The method name coxa() is also unclear. However basic structure is present.","tokens":502,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. Well-structured conditional with proper indentation. Could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of explicit if-else. Variable name \u0027a\u0027 is not descriptive but acceptable in this context.","tokens":283,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
