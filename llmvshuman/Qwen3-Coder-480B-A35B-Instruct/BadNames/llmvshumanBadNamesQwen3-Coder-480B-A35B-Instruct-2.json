{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and straightforward with clear variable names and simple logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements needed for constant naming convention and documentation.","tokens":244,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context Making it extremely difficult to understand the business logic or purpose of this calculation without additional documentation","tokens":254,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The logic using ordinal() and array indexing is confusing without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. Code lacks documentation and readability","tokens":248,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and implements leap year logic correctly with clear conditional structure. The method name could be more descriptive (isLeapYear instead of isAB) and the nested conditions could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly without if-else block.","tokens":282,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is not readable due to meaningless variable names (paprica alecrim menta) that provide no semantic context. The method name and parameter names are random words making code comprehension extremely difficult. Logic is simple but obfuscated by poor naming conventions","tokens":249,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, etc.), undefined variables (feijaoVerde.nextFloat(), aspargos, aipo), lack of comments, and unclear logic flow. The method name coxa() is also non-descriptive. However, basic structure is present.","tokens":506,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code uses meaningless variable names (batata, salsa, abobora, etc.) that make it impossible to understand the logic. Method names and variable names appear to be random food items rather than descriptive identifiers. No comments or documentation to explain purpose. Structure is simple but completely obfuscated by poor naming conventions.","tokens":335,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming (p d s n), complex nested operations without clear purpose, magic numbers (2 1 10), lack of comments or documentation, and convoluted logic that is hard to follow. The method appears to implement some checksum algorithm but is very difficult to understand due to cryptic variable names and absence of explanatory comments.","tokens":490,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable names like nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena which obscure the actual logic. The method name Month menta provides no clarity about functionality. While the arithmetic logic appears correct for month calculation the poor naming conventions make comprehension extremely difficult. No comments or documentation exist to aid understanding. The code structure is compact but cryptic making maintenance and debugging challenging for other developers.","tokens":318,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
