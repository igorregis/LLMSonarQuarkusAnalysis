{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless variable names (nozMoscada oregano) and unclear method name (menta) that make code purpose difficult to understand","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow Java naming conventions. The expression uses magic numbers like 3 without explanation. Variable pimentaCaiena is not descriptive. No comments or documentation provided. Logic is obscure without context.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to read due to meaningless variable names (alecrim menta paprica) that obscure the actual logic. The method name and parameter names provide no semantic meaning making it hard to understand the purpose. While the logic itself is simple the poor naming conventions severely impact readability and maintainability","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, etc.) that make code hard to understand. Mixed Portuguese and English terms create confusion. Unclear logic flow and lack of comments make comprehension difficult. Variable naming conventions are inconsistent and obscure the code\u0027s purpose.","tokens":502,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and straightforward with clear variable names and simple logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements needed for constant naming convention and documentation.","tokens":244,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable but uses unclear method names that dont convey business meaning well GetBrocolis getEspinafre and getJaca are not descriptive enough for proper comprehension despite the simple ternary logic implementation","tokens":253,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to unclear variable names (p d s), complex nested operations, lack of comments, and convoluted logic flow. The method performs mathematical operations on string digits but the purpose and algorithm are difficult to understand without domain knowledge. Variable naming and structure make maintenance challenging.","tokens":477,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable and implements the leap year logic correctly with proper indentation and clear structure. The method name and variable are meaningful. However it could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly instead of using if-else. The logic is straightforward to understand for developers familiar with leap year calculations.","tokens":291,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to read due to meaningless variable names (batata, salsa, abobora, etc.) that obscure the actual logic. Method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and parameter \u0027pimenta\u0027 are also unclear. While the mathematical operations are straightforward, the lack of semantic meaning in identifiers makes comprehension challenging for other developers.","tokens":340,"name":"Combine.java"}
