{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear mathematical operation. Variable names could be more descriptive (base height area) but logic is straightforward. Good use of explicit parentheses for clarity. Minor improvement needed in naming conventions for better maintainability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic variable names (p, s, d, i, n), complex nested operations, and lack of comments or documentation. The algorithm\u0027s purpose is unclear and the code is difficult to maintain or understand without significant reverse engineering effort.","tokens":472,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is barely readable due to meaningless variable names like nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena which obscure the actual logic. The method name menta is also unclear. While the arithmetic logic appears functional the poor naming conventions make comprehension extremely difficult for maintenance and collaboration purposes.","tokens":291,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, etc.), undefined variables (aspargos, aipo, MILHOS), unclear method purpose, and lack of comments or documentation. The logic is difficult to follow and maintain.","tokens":499,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names (Brocolis Espinafre Jaca) that provide no semantic context. The ternary operator logic is simple but the cryptic naming makes comprehension difficult. No comments or documentation to clarify intent. While functionally correct the code is not maintainable or self-documenting.","tokens":277,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and logic is clear for determining leap years. Well-structured conditional with proper indentation. Could be slightly improved by removing redundant else clause and directly returning the boolean expression result.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable and easy to understand with clear variable names and straightforward logic. The method calculates circle area using radius. Only minor improvements could be made with more descriptive method name and parameter name.","tokens":250,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear and doesnt follow Java naming conventions. The logic uses array indexing with ordinal division that is hard to understand without context. Variable names like pimentaCaiena are not descriptive. No comments or documentation to explain the purpose. The code is functional but poorly readable due to naming and lack of clarity","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is difficult to read due to meaningless variable names (paprica alecrim menta) that obscure the actual logic. The method name and parameter names provide no semantic meaning making it hard to understand the purpose. While the mathematical operation is simple the obfuscated naming makes comprehension challenging.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code uses meaningless variable names (pimenta, batata, salsa) that obscure the actual functionality. Method names (abobora, gengibre) are also unclear. While the mathematical operations are straightforward, the lack of semantic naming makes it very difficult to understand the purpose and logic of this code.","tokens":335,"name":"Combine.java"}
