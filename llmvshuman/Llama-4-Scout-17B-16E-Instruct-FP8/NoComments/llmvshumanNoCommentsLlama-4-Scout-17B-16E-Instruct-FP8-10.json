{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper operator usage. However, it can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":266,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with clear method and variable names. However, it assumes the existence of external methods and variables, which might require additional context for full comprehension.","tokens":272,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. However, the magic number 12 and the ENUMS array are not explicitly defined in this snippet, which might affect comprehension.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a simple mathematical formula. However, the value of PI could be more precise and a constant from a Math library could be used for better accuracy.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is mostly straightforward, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The method does multiple things: generates random children, assigns fonts and colors, and inserts them into a tree. Breaking it down into smaller methods would improve readability.","tokens":445,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear and descriptive variable names, and the calculation is simple and well-structured. However, the method name could be improved to follow standard Java naming conventions (e.g., camelCase).","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is not easily readable due to complex logic and variable naming. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments makes it hard to understand. The algorithm itself seems to be implementing a digit verification calculation, but it\u0027s overly complicated and uses inefficient methods like string manipulation for arithmetic operations.","tokens":497,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name. The use of ordinal() and ENUMS array is efficient, but may require some knowledge of the enum\u0027s context. The variable name could be more descriptive, but overall it\u0027s easy to understand.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is short but uses an unclear method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 which translates to \u0027subtract\u0027 in English, yet it calls another method \u0027soma\u0027 which translates to \u0027add\u0027. The logic is not straightforward as it uses a modulus operation and a negative sign. The variable name \u0027meses\u0027 is clear, but overall, it requires some thought to understand the intent.","tokens":271,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is 0, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the possible implications of returning 0.0d when getContagem() is 0 would improve readability.","tokens":292,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
