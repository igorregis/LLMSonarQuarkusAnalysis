{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper modulus operations. However, it can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":266,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a simple mathematical formula. However, the value of PI could be more precise and considered for a constant.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is not easily readable due to complex logic and variable naming. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments makes it harder to understand. However, the overall structure is clear, and the algorithm is recognizable.","tokens":484,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. However, the magic number 12 and the ENUMS array are not explicitly defined in this snippet, which might affect comprehension.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name. The use of ordinal() and ENUMS array is efficient, but may require some knowledge of the enum\u0027s ordinal method. The magic number 3 may benefit from a named constant for better understanding.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear and descriptive variable names, and the formula for calculating the area of a triangle is simple and well-known. However, the method name could be improved for better readability, and a comment explaining the purpose of the method would be helpful.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is short but uses an unclear method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 which translates to \u0027subtract\u0027 in English, yet it calls another method \u0027soma\u0027 which translates to \u0027add\u0027. The logic is not straightforward as it uses a modulus operation and negation to achieve subtraction, making it somewhat confusing.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is 0, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the possible return values could improve comprehension.","tokens":278,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It appears to be part of a class that accumulates statistics. The method name `combine` clearly indicates its purpose. The use of descriptive variable names like `count`, `min`, and `max` helps comprehension. However, the method modifies the object state without clear indication of its preconditions or invariants, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":311,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are clear, and the logic is easy to follow. However, some improvements could be made, such as adding comments to explain the purpose of the method and the logic behind it. Additionally, some variable names could be more descriptive, e.g., \u0027contador\u0027 could be \u0027counter\u0027. The use of whitespace is consistent, making it easy to read.","tokens":479,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
