{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper modulus operations. However, it can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":266,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with clear method and variable names. However, it assumes the existence of external methods and variables, which might require additional context to fully understand.","tokens":272,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name. The use of ordinal() and ENUMS array is efficient, but may require external context for full understanding.","tokens":236,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a simple mathematical formula. However, the value of PI could be more precise and considered as a constant.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, but its readability is compromised by long lines, complex operations within loops, and unclear variable names. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments makes comprehension harder.","tokens":483,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and the formula for the area of a triangle is simple and well-known. However, the method name could be improved for better readability, and a comment explaining the purpose of the method would be helpful.","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and simple approach to calculate the new month. The use of modulus operator to handle wrap-around is efficient. However, the variable name \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and the method \u0027ordinal()\u0027 are not defined in this snippet, which might affect understanding.","tokens":272,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is mostly straightforward, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The method does a specific task, but the purpose could be clearer with additional comments. The use of magic numbers and arrays (e.g., \u00272\u0027 in contador % 2) could be improved for readability.","tokens":456,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is short but uses an unclear method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 which translates to \u0027subtract\u0027 in English, yet it calls another method \u0027soma\u0027 which translates to \u0027add\u0027. The logic is not straightforward as it uses a modulus operation and negation to achieve subtraction, making it less readable.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is 0, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the possible implications of returning 0.0d when getContagem() is 0 would improve readability.","tokens":292,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
