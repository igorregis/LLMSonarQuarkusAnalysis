{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper variable names. However, the if-else statement can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":269,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. However, the magic number 12 and the ENUMS array are not explicitly defined in this snippet, which might affect comprehension.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and standard Java method name and assumes the existence of an ENUMS array and an ordinal method, likely from an enum class. The logic is straightforward, but context is limited.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is short but its readability and comprehension are hindered by the use of non-standard method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027 for subtraction and addition operations respectively, and the use of modulus operator without clear context.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a single, well-defined variable. However, the value of PI could be more precise and a constant from a Math library could be used instead of a hardcoded value.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is not easily readable due to its complexity and variable naming. It appears to be calculating a check digit using the base 10 algorithm, but the logic is hard to follow. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments makes it difficult to understand.","tokens":493,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear and descriptive variable names, and the formula for calculating the area of a triangle is simple and well-known. However, the method name could be improved to follow standard Java naming conventions (e.g., camelCase).","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is 0, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the possible return values would improve readability.","tokens":278,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It appears to be part of a class that accumulates statistics. The method name `combine` clearly indicates its purpose. The use of descriptive variable names like `count`, `min`, and `max` helps comprehension. However, the method modifies the object state without clear indication of its preconditions or invariants, which could slightly hinder understanding.","tokens":312,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are clear, and the logic is easy to follow. However, some improvements could be made, such as adding comments to explain the purpose of the method and the logic behind it. Additionally, some variable names could be more descriptive, e.g., \u0027contador\u0027 could be \u0027counter\u0027. The use of whitespace is consistent, making it easy to read.","tokens":479,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
