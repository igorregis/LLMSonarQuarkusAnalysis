{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper modulus operations. However, it can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":266,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a simple mathematical formula. However, the value of PI could be more precise and considered for a constant.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and hard to read. Variable names are not descriptive. The logic is complex and split into multiple loops, making it difficult to follow. There are also unnecessary conversions between String and Integer.","tokens":482,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. The use of modulus operators ensures the result stays within a clear range. However, the constant \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and the method \u0027ordinal()\u0027 are not defined in this snippet, which might affect comprehension.","tokens":271,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear and descriptive variable names, and the formula for calculating the area of a triangle is simple and well-known. However, the method name could be improved for better readability, and a comment explaining the purpose of the method would be helpful.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It appears to be part of a class that accumulates statistics. The method name `combine` clearly indicates its purpose. The operations are straightforward, but a brief comment explaining the purpose of the method and the context of `sumWithCompensation` would improve comprehension.","tokens":297,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name. The use of ordinal() and ENUMS array is efficient, but may require some knowledge of the enum\u0027s ordinal method and the ENUMS array context. Assuming ENUMS is an array of Months, the code is easy to understand.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is mostly straightforward, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The method does a specific task, but it\u0027s not immediately clear what the task is without reading the code. The use of magic numbers and external variables (e.g., geradorNomes, NOMES, fontes) makes it harder to understand.","tokens":462,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is zero, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the meaning of the return value would improve readability.","tokens":279,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is short but its readability and comprehension are hindered by the method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 which suggests subtraction, but it actually calls another method \u0027soma\u0027. The variable name \u0027meses\u0027 is clear, but the use of modulus operator and negation could be clearer with additional comments. The method name \u0027soma\u0027 is not shown here, but its name does not suggest subtraction.","tokens":274,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
