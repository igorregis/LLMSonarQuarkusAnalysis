{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with clear method and variable names. However, it assumes the existence of external methods and variables, which might make it harder to understand without additional context.","tokens":274,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and effectively determines if a year is a leap year. It uses clear logic and proper variable names. However, the if-else statement can be simplified for better readability.","tokens":269,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and standard Java method name. The use of ordinal() and ENUMS array is efficient, but may require external context for full understanding.","tokens":237,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a clear and descriptive method name and a simple mathematical formula. However, the value of PI could be more precise and considered as a constant from a library.","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is not easily readable due to complex logic and variable naming. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments makes it hard to understand. The algorithm itself seems to be implementing a digit verification calculation, but it\u0027s obfuscated by poor coding practices.","tokens":491,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses clear and descriptive variable names, and the formula for calculating the area of a triangle is simple and well-known. However, the method name could be improved to follow standard Java naming conventions (e.g., camelCase).","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is short but uses an unclear method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 which translates to \u0027subtract\u0027 in English, yet it calls another method \u0027soma\u0027 which translates to \u0027add\u0027. The logic is not straightforward, making it hard to understand without additional context.","tokens":248,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear and simple approach to calculate the new month. The use of modulus operator to handle wrap-around is efficient. However, the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 are not defined in this snippet, which might affect understanding.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to handle the case where getContagem() is 0, avoiding division by zero. The use of \u0027public final\u0027 and a clear method name like \u0027getMedia\u0027 is good practice. However, a comment explaining the purpose of the method and the possible return values would improve readability.","tokens":278,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are clear, and the logic is easy to follow. However, some improvements could be made, such as adding comments to explain the purpose of the method and the logic behind it. Additionally, the variable names could be more descriptive, e.g., \u0027contador\u0027 could be \u0027counter\u0027. The method is also doing multiple things at once, which could be improved for readability and maintainability.","tokens":486,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
