{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses clear and descriptive variable names and includes a helpful Javadoc comment. However, the conditional statement can be simplified to improve readability.","tokens":342,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It has clear documentation and proper exception handling. However, the method name \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 is not standard and its purpose is not immediately clear, which prevents a perfect score.","tokens":339,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and clear in its purpose, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The use of comments explains the logic behind the code, which is complex. However, the code could benefit from more modularity and direct calculations instead of string manipulations.","tokens":890,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and concise, with clear documentation. The use of Javadoc-style comments provides good explanation of the method\u0027s purpose and behavior. However, the method\u0027s logic relies on understanding the `soma` method, which is not shown here.","tokens":345,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The method name is clear and the use of ENUMS is efficient. However, the magic number 3 and the ordinal() method could be better explained. The Javadoc provides good context but some variable names could be more explicit.","tokens":363,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It has clear documentation with a description, parameter explanations, and a return value description. The variable names are descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The only suggestion for improvement would be to consider adding input validation for negative values.","tokens":346,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable and concise. It uses meaningful variable names and comments in Portuguese. The logic is clear, and the use of whitespace is consistent. However, some variable names could be translated to English for better understanding, and a few comments are not in standard English, which may limit readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":554,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name, and the Javadoc comment effectively describes the method\u0027s purpose, parameter, and return value. The use of a final variable for PI is good practice. However, the comment about PI\u0027s approximation could be improved, and the code could benefit from using Math.PI for accuracy.","tokens":363,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear method name and Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. The use of modulus operator to handle wrap-around and negative values is efficient. However, the variable name \u0027amount\u0027 could be more descriptive and the constant \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might affect understanding.","tokens":382,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear Javadoc comment explaining its purpose and behavior. The use of the ternary operator is a good practice here, making the code compact and easy to understand. However, the score is not perfect because it assumes knowledge of related methods like getContagem() and getSoma(), which are not shown here.","tokens":381,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
