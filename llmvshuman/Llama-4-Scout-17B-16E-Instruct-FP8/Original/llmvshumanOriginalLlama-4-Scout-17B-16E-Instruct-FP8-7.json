{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses clear and descriptive variable names and includes a helpful Javadoc comment. However, the condition in the if statement can be simplified to improve readability.","tokens":345,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with clear method and variable names. The use of Javadoc comments adds clarity. However, some variable names (e.g., simpleSum, sumCompensation) could be more descriptive.","tokens":335,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and clear in its purpose, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The use of comments explains the logic, but the code could benefit from more concise methods and Java 8+ features for better readability.","tokens":884,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The method name is descriptive and the use of ENUMS is clear. However, the magic number 3 and the ordinal() method could be explained for better understanding. The Javadoc provides a good explanation of the method\u0027s behavior.","tokens":363,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It has clear documentation with a description, parameter explanations, and a return value description. The variable names are descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The only suggestion for improvement would be to consider adding input validation for negative values.","tokens":346,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and concise, with clear documentation. The use of Javadoc-style comments is good for readability. The method name `subtrai` and variable names like `meses` are descriptive. However, the method calls another method `soma`, which is not shown here, adding some complexity.","tokens":357,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and comments. However, some variable names are in Portuguese, which may limit readability for non-native speakers. Additionally, the method does multiple things: initializes children, sets their properties, and inserts them into the tree, which could be broken down for better clarity.","tokens":551,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear Javadoc comment explaining its purpose and behavior. The use of the ternary operator is a good practice here, making the code compact. However, it assumes that getContagem() and getSoma() are well-documented and easy to understand, which might not be the case.","tokens":377,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear method name and Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. The use of modulus operator to handle wrap-around and negative values is efficient. However, the variable name \u0027amount\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the constant \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might affect understanding.","tokens":383,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name, and the Javadoc comment effectively describes the method\u0027s purpose, parameter, and return value. The use of a final variable for PI is good practice. However, the comment about PI\u0027s approximation could be improved, and the code could benefit from using Math.PI for accuracy.","tokens":363,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
