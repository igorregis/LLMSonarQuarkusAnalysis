{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name is clear, and the Javadoc comment explains its purpose. The logic is straightforward, but a more idiomatic Java approach could simplify the return statement to a single boolean expression.","tokens":353,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and clear in its purpose, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The use of comments is good, but a few are in Portuguese, which may cause a language barrier. The algorithm is straightforward, but could be optimized for readability and performance.","tokens":892,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear Javadoc comment explaining its purpose and behavior. The use of the ternary operator is a good practice here, making the code compact and easy to understand. However, it could be improved with additional comments or variable extraction for better clarity.","tokens":367,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It has clear documentation with a description, parameter explanations, and a return value description. The variable names are descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The only suggestion for improvement would be to consider adding input validation for negative values.","tokens":346,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses clear and descriptive variable names. The method\u0027s purpose is clearly explained in the Javadoc comment. However, it assumes the reader is familiar with the concept of \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 and its purpose is not immediately clear without additional context.","tokens":352,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable and concise. It uses meaningful variable names and comments in Portuguese. The logic is clear, and the use of whitespace is consistent. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and a few comments are not in English, which may limit understanding for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":549,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The method name is clear and the use of ENUMS is efficient. However, the magic number 3 could be replaced with a named constant for better understanding. The comment is in Portuguese and explains the purpose of the method, but it may not be clear for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":375,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses clear variable names and includes a detailed Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, behavior, and parameters. The use of modulus operator to handle wrap-around and negative values is efficient. However, the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 are not defined in this snippet, which might affect understanding.","tokens":377,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and concise, with clear documentation. The use of Javadoc-style comments is good for readability. However, the method name `subtrai` is in Portuguese, which may not be immediately clear to all developers. The variable name `meses` is descriptive, but `soma` is not defined in this snippet, which could affect understanding.","tokens":368,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. It uses a clear and descriptive method name, and the Javadoc comment effectively describes the method\u0027s purpose, parameter, and return value. The use of a final variable for PI is good practice. However, the comment about PI\u0027s approximation could be improved for clarity, and the code could benefit from using Math.PI for precision.","tokens":365,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
