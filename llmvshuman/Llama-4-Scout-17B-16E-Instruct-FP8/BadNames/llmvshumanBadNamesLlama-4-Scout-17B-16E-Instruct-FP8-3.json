{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and a mysterious method \u0027menta\u0027. The purpose of the method is not immediately clear, making it harder to understand.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name can be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and relies on external, undefined variables and methods, making it hard to understand. It appears to calculate a month based on a modulus operation, but the logic is not straightforward without context.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and a simple mathematical operation. However, the variable names could be more descriptive. \u0027tomilho\u0027 could be \u0027getSpecificMonth\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 could be \u0027months\u0027 or \u0027monthArray\u0027.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name \u0027r\u0027 and the calculation is simple. However, the value of PI is approximated and not defined as a constant with a meaningful name, it could be improved using Math.PI.","tokens":267,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name `getBrocolis` suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is obscure. The use of ternary operator and reliance on other getter methods makes it less straightforward. Names like `getEspinafre` and `getJaca` don\u0027t indicate their relevance to `getBrocolis`.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verifier. Variable names are poor, and there are no comments. The use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) and complex operations (e.g., substring, valueOf) makes it hard to understand without deeper analysis.","tokens":490,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but the context is missing. The use of magic numbers and undefined variables (e.g., \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027) adds to the confusion. However, the structure and control flow are relatively simple.","tokens":504,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027 do not provide clear context. Additionally, the method \u0027abobora\u0027 is called with different operations, which could be confusing without proper documentation.","tokens":332,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and simple. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, it\u0027s easy to understand but could benefit from better naming conventions.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
