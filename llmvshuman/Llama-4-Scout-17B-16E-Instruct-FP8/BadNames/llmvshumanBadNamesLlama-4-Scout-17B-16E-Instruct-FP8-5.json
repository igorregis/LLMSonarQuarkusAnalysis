{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name can be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear and simple.","tokens":248,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name \u0027r\u0027 and the calculation is simple. However, the value of PI could be more precise and a constant.","tokens":254,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names. The method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 and variable references like \u0027getEspinafre\u0027 and \u0027getJaca\u0027 do not provide clear context, making it difficult to understand the purpose of the method without additional information.","tokens":267,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not indicate their purpose. The use of magic number 12 and method \u0027menta\u0027 without clear relation to \u0027paprica\u0027 or context adds to the confusion.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and a simple calculation to determine the return value. However, the variable names could be more descriptive. What does \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 represent? A comment or more descriptive names would improve comprehension.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and assumes the existence of external variables or fields (pimentaCaiena). The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027oregano\u0027 and \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 do not clearly indicate their purpose. The calculation is not straightforward without understanding the context.","tokens":285,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand without additional context. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027pimenta\u0027, \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, etc., are not descriptive. Similarly, method calls like \u0027abobora\u0027 do not indicate their purpose.","tokens":327,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but the context is missing. The use of magic numbers and undefined variables (e.g., \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027) adds to the confusion. However, the structure and control flow are relatively simple.","tokens":504,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are poor, and there are no comments. The use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) and complex operations (e.g., substring, valueOf) makes it hard to understand. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps.","tokens":499,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
