{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name can be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand. It appears to be updating object state based on input statistics, but the purpose and context are unclear without additional information.","tokens":301,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name and a simple formula. However, the value of PI is not precise and a constant. Consider using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name `getBrocolis` suggests a simple getter, but the logic is complex. It uses a ternary operator with multiple method calls, making it harder to understand. The variable and method names do not follow conventional Java naming conventions, adding to the confusion.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and assumes the existence of external variables or fields (pimentaCaiena). The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027oregano\u0027 and \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 do not clearly indicate their purpose. The calculation is not straightforward without understanding the context.","tokens":285,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and correctly applies array indexing. However, the variable names could be more descriptive. The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 suggest a specific domain but their meaning is not immediately clear to a non-expert.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not convey meaning. The use of a modulus operation and negation suggests a calculation, but the purpose is unclear without context. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 is also unclear. A more readable version would use descriptive names and possibly comments.","tokens":267,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and simple. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, it\u0027s easy to understand but could benefit from better naming conventions.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are poor, and there are no comments. The use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) and complex operations (e.g., substring, valueOf) makes it hard to understand. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps.","tokens":499,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but context is missing. The use of non-descriptive variable names like \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027, and \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027 reduces readability. Additionally, undefined variables like \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027, and \u0027aboboraMaca\u0027 are used, which further complicates comprehension.","tokens":527,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
