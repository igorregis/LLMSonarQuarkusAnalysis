{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and a mysterious method \u0027menta\u0027. The purpose of the method is not immediately clear, making it harder to understand.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name could be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is complex and relies on unclear method names. The use of ternary operator is concise but may impact readability. The return type is specific and clear.","tokens":258,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. The use of ordinal() and array indexing is straightforward. However, the context and the definition of pimentaCaiena and ordinal() are not shown, which could affect comprehension.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are single letters, making it hard to understand without reading the code. The use of ternary operators and substring operations adds complexity. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps comprehension.","tokens":481,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name \u0027r\u0027 and the calculation is simple. However, the value of PI is approximated and not defined as a constant with a meaningful name, it could be improved using Math.PI.","tokens":267,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and assumes the existence of external variables or fields (pimentaCaiena). The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027oregano\u0027 and \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 do not clearly indicate their purpose. The use of magic numbers (12) also reduces readability.","tokens":287,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027 do not provide clear context. Additionally, the method \u0027abobora\u0027 is called with different operations, which could be confusing without proper documentation or clear naming conventions.","tokens":336,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but context is missing. The use of non-descriptive variable names like \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027, and \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027 reduces readability. Additionally, undefined variables like \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, and \u0027aipo\u0027 add to the confusion.","tokens":516,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
