{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name could be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name \u0027r\u0027 and the calculation is simple. However, the value of PI could be more precise and a constant.","tokens":254,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verifier. Variable names are poor, and there are no comments. The use of a temporary array and multiple loops makes it hard to follow. Some variable names and comments would greatly improve readability.","tokens":476,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. The use of ordinal() and simple arithmetic operations makes it easy to comprehend. However, context about the enum Month and the array pimentaCaiena would improve understanding.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand without additional context. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027 do not provide clear indication of their purpose.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and relies on external context. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive in a standard Java context. The use of magic numbers like 12 also reduces readability.","tokens":286,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not convey meaning. The use of a negative value in the modulus operation and then passing it to another method \u0027menta\u0027 is not straightforward. More context or documentation would be needed for better understanding.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name `getBrocolis` suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is obscure. The use of ternary operator and reliance on other getter methods makes it less straightforward. Names like `getEspinafre` and `getJaca` don\u0027t convey meaning in English, potentially hindering comprehension for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":279,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and simple. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, it\u0027s easy to understand but could benefit from better naming conventions.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but context is missing. The use of non-descriptive variable names like \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027, and \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027 reduces readability. Additionally, undefined variables like \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, and \u0027aipo\u0027 add to the confusion.","tokens":516,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
