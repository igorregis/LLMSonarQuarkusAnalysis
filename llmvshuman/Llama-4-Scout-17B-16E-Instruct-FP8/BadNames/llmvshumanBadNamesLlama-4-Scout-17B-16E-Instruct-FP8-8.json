{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name could be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand without additional context. The method and variable names do not follow conventional Java naming standards, which affects readability.","tokens":298,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and a mysterious method \u0027menta\u0027. The purpose of the method is not immediately clear, making it somewhat hard to understand.","tokens":231,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and standard Java API methods like \u0027ordinal()\u0027. However, the variable and method names could be more descriptive. The context of \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and \u0027Month\u0027 is unclear.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name and a simple formula. However, the value of pi is hardcoded and not defined as a constant with a descriptive name, which could be improved for readability and maintainability.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are single letters, making it hard to understand without reading the code carefully. The use of ternary operators and substring operations adds complexity. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps comprehension.","tokens":482,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name `getBrocolis` suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is obscure. The use of ternary operator and reliance on other getter methods makes it less straightforward. Names like `getEspinafre` and `getJaca` don\u0027t indicate their relevance to `getBrocolis`.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and relies on magic numbers, making it hard to understand. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027oregano\u0027 and \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 don\u0027t clearly indicate their purpose. The use of ordinal() is also unclear as it\u0027s not defined in this snippet.","tokens":286,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, it\u0027s simple and readable.","tokens":271,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but the context is not clear. The use of magic numbers and undefined variables (e.g., \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027) adds to the confusion. However, the structure and logic seem coherent.","tokens":503,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
