{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified, and variable names could be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name and a simple formula. However, the value of PI is approximated and could be replaced with Math.PI for better accuracy.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and simple. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the formula is clear. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could also be more specific.","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not indicate their purpose. The use of magic number 12 and method \u0027menta\u0027 without clear relation to \u0027paprica\u0027 also reduces readability.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and a simple mathematical operation. However, the variable names could be more descriptive. The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is not a standard Java method name and its purpose is not clear without context.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and relies on external context. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive in a general context, suggesting a specific domain or culture. The calculation is not immediately clear without understanding the context of the variables.","tokens":294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name `getBrocolis` suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is complex. The use of ternary operator and reliance on other getters (`getEspinafre`, `getJaca`) makes it less straightforward. Names like `getEspinafre` and `getJaca` don\u0027t convey meaning, but the code structure is simple.","tokens":283,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027 do not provide clear context. Additionally, the method modifies external state without clear indication of what it does or what the parameters represent.","tokens":329,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but the context is missing. The use of magic numbers and undefined variables (e.g., \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027) adds to the confusion. However, the structure and control flow are relatively simple.","tokens":504,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are poor, and there are no comments. The use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) and complex operations (e.g., substring, valueOf) makes it hard to understand. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps.","tokens":500,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
