{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and directly implements a well-known algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year. However, the condition can be simplified and the method name could be more descriptive.","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear method name and understandable variable names. The use of ordinal() and simple arithmetic operations makes it easy to comprehend. However, context about the enum and array would improve understanding.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. The variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027, to improve readability.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not indicate their purpose. The use of magic number 12 and method \u0027menta\u0027 without clear relation to \u0027paprica\u0027 also reduces readability.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is dense and performs a specific calculation, likely a digit verification algorithm. Variable names are poor, making it hard to understand. The use of magic numbers and complex operations in loops adds to the difficulty. However, the structure is mostly linear, which helps comprehension.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 suggests a clear purpose, but the calculation is obscure. The use of ternary operator and reliance on other getter methods makes it less straightforward. Names like \u0027getEspinafre\u0027 and \u0027getJaca\u0027 don\u0027t convey meaning beyond being getters.","tokens":269,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names and method calls, making it hard to understand without additional context. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027 do not provide clear indication of their purpose.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a clear and descriptive variable name and a simple formula. However, the value of pi is hardcoded and not defined as a constant with a descriptive name, which could be improved for readability and maintainability.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, making it hard to understand. It appears to be part of a larger system, but context is missing. The use of magic numbers and undefined variables (e.g., \u0027aspargos\u0027, \u0027MILHOS\u0027, \u0027aipo\u0027) adds to the confusion. However, the structure and logic seem coherent.","tokens":501,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and relies on external context. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive in a general context, suggesting a specific domain knowledge. The calculation is not complex but the intent is hard to understand without further context.","tokens":295,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
