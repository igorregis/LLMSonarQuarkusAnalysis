{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-speakers. Logic is clear but relies on another method. Simple arithmetic operation is easy to understand.","tokens":210,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement possible for absolute clarity.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, multiple string-number conversions, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":469,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese readers. Logic is clear with good structure but mixed language reduces readability. Font handling and color assignment are straightforward but naming conventions are inconsistent.","tokens":450,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic for calculating the first month of a quarter. The use of ENUMS array and ordinal division is straightforward but assumes familiarity with enum ordinal positions.","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic directly. Method name in Portuguese may confuse non-speakers, but logic is straightforward and well-structured.","tokens":251,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names, proper indentation, and simple logic. Using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value would improve it further.","tokens":235,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Method name clearly describes purpose in Portuguese. Simple formula implementation with clear variable names. No unnecessary complexity. Easy to understand even for non-Portuguese speakers familiar with geometry.","tokens":232,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not self-explanatory and require external context to understand their purpose.","tokens":262,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but uses magic numbers and unclear variable naming. The modulo arithmetic is correct but requires mental effort to understand the month wrapping logic.","tokens":231,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
