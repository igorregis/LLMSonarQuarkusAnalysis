{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear with modulo operation and method reuse, but lacks parameter validation and documentation.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable. Uses ternary operator for clear conditional logic. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement would be adding parentheses for explicit operator precedence.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, string manipulation for arithmetic, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":469,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear but mixing languages reduces readability. Good structure and consistent naming within the Portuguese context.","tokens":445,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to find the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined here, slightly reducing readability.","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, using standard leap year logic. Method name in Portuguese may confuse non-speakers, but logic is straightforward and well-structured.","tokens":251,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Method is clear with descriptive name and variables. Uses final for PI constant. Simple calculation and direct return. Could use Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":233,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. Perfectly follows Java naming conventions and is self-documenting.","tokens":226,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but uses magic numbers and unclear variable names. The modulo arithmetic is correct but requires mental effort to understand the month wrapping logic.","tokens":231,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
