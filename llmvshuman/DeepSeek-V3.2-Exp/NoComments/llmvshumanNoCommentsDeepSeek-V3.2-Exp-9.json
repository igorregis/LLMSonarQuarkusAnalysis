{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-native speakers. Logic is clear but relies on another method. Good use of modulo operator for month calculation.","tokens":211,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Could be slightly more explicit for beginners.","tokens":222,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, multiple string-number conversions, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese readers. Logic is clear with proper structure and comments would help. Some complex font handling but overall readable.","tokens":444,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to find the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined in the snippet, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":228,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic correctly. Could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":250,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Method is clear with descriptive name and variables. Uses final for PI constant. Simple calculation and direct return. Could use Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":233,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. No complexity or confusion.","tokens":218,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but uses modulo arithmetic with magic numbers 12 making logic hard to follow. ENUMS array access requires external context. Good naming but complex calculation reduces readability.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
