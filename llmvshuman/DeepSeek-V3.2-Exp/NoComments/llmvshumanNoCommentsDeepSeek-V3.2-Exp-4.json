{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese may confuse non-native speakers. Logic is simple but relies on another method. Clear modulo operation but lacks comments.","tokens":208,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement possible for absolute beginners.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, multiple string-number conversions, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variables which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear with good method separation, but variable naming reduces readability for international teams.","tokens":441,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic for calculating the first month of a quarter. The use of ENUMS array and ordinal division is straightforward but assumes familiarity with enum ordinal positions.","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic correctly. Could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":250,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and simple logic. Using Math.PI would improve it. Well-structured and easy to understand.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. No complexity or confusion.","tokens":218,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but has readability issues. Magic number 12 appears multiple times without explanation. The calculation logic is not immediately clear due to nested operations and lack of comments.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
