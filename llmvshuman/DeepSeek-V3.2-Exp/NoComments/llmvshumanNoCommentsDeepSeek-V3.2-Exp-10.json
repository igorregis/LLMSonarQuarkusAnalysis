{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-speakers. Logic is clear but relies on another method. Simple arithmetic operation is easy to understand.","tokens":210,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement would be adding comments for documentation.","tokens":229,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, string manipulation for arithmetic, and lack of comments. Logic is not immediately clear, requiring careful analysis to understand the algorithm.","tokens":471,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variables which may confuse non-Portuguese readers. Logic is clear with good method separation but variable naming reduces readability for international teams.","tokens":440,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic for calculating the first month of a quarter. The use of ENUMS array and ordinal division is straightforward but assumes familiarity with enum ordinal positions.","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic directly. Could be slightly improved by removing else block for direct return.","tokens":245,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Method is clear with descriptive naming. Uses final constant for PI. Simple calculation and direct return. Could use Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":231,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. Perfectly follows Java naming conventions and is self-documenting.","tokens":226,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but has poor variable naming and unclear logic. The modulo operations make it hard to understand the month calculation without context.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
