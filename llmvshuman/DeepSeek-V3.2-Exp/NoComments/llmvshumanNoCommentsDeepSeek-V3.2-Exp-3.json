{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-speakers. Logic is clear with modulo and negation, but depends on external soma method. Short and concise.","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable. Uses ternary operator for clear conditional logic. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement would be adding parentheses for explicit operator precedence.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, mixed string/integer operations, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear but naming conventions mix languages. Method structure is readable with proper spacing and organization.","tokens":444,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to find the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined in the snippet, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":228,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, uses standard leap year logic. Method name in Portuguese may slightly hinder non-native readers, but logic is straightforward and well-structured.","tokens":252,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and simple logic. Using Math.PI would improve it. Well-structured and easy to understand.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. Perfectly follows Java naming conventions and is self-documenting.","tokens":226,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation method calls are somewhat confusing without context, and the purpose of compensation isn\u0027t immediately obvious.","tokens":264,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but uses magic numbers and unclear variable names. The modulo arithmetic is correct but requires mental effort to understand the month wrapping logic.","tokens":231,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
