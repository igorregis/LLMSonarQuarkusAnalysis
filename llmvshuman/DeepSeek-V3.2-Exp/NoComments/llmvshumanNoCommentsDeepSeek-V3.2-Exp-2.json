{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-native speakers. Logic is clear but relies on another method. Simple arithmetic operation is easy to understand.","tokens":210,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement possible for absolute clarity.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, multiple string-number conversions, and unclear algorithm purpose. Variable names are non-descriptive and logic flow is convoluted.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear but naming conventions mix languages. Method structure is readable with proper spacing and comments would help.","tokens":446,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to find the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined here, slightly reducing readability.","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic directly. Could be slightly improved by removing else block for direct return.","tokens":245,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and simple logic. Using Math.PI would improve accuracy and readability. Well-structured and easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Method name clearly describes purpose in Portuguese. Simple formula implementation with clear variable names. No unnecessary complexity. Easy to understand even for non-Portuguese speakers due to standard mathematical formula.","tokens":234,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but has readability issues. Magic number 12 appears multiple times without explanation. The calculation logic is not immediately clear due to nested operations and lack of comments.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
