{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-speakers. Logic is clear with modulo and negation, but depends on external soma method. Short and concise.","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with ternary operator. Clear logic for calculating average with null check. Method names are descriptive. Only minor improvement would be adding comments for complex scenarios.","tokens":230,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, multiple string-number conversions, and unclear algorithm purpose. Nested loops and manual digit splitting reduce maintainability.","tokens":467,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is clear but naming conventions mix languages. Method structure is readable with proper spacing and organization.","tokens":445,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to find the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined in the snippet, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":228,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic correctly. Could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":250,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive naming, proper use of final constant, and straightforward logic. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value.","tokens":236,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Method name clearly describes purpose in Portuguese. Simple formula implementation with clear variable names. No unnecessary complexity. Easy to understand even for junior developers.","tokens":225,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not immediately intuitive without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":258,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method logic is compact but requires understanding of modulo arithmetic and ENUMS array. Ordinal usage is clear but overall readability is moderate due to mathematical operations.","tokens":234,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
