{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces readability for non-native speakers. Logic is clear but relies on another method. Simple modulo operation and negation are easy to understand.","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable. Uses ternary operator effectively for conditional logic. Method names clearly indicate purpose. Only minor improvement would be adding parentheses for clarity.","tokens":226,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is functional but hard to read due to complex indexing, string manipulation for arithmetic, and unclear algorithm purpose. Multiple loops with reverse iteration and null checks add unnecessary complexity.","tokens":468,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese variable names which may confuse non-Portuguese readers. Logic is clear but mixing languages reduces readability. Good structure and comments would help.","tokens":441,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear logic with division and multiplication to calculate the first month of a quarter. However, the ENUMS array is not defined in the snippet, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":228,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, follows leap year logic correctly. Could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":250,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clean and readable with clear variable names and simple logic. Using Math.PI would improve it slightly for better accuracy and standard practice.","tokens":231,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear method name, simple calculation, and direct return. No complexity or confusion.","tokens":218,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method with descriptive names but compensation logic is slightly complex requiring extra attention to understand the mathematical operations","tokens":246,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but lacks clarity on ENUMS array purpose and ordinal method. Type casting and modulo arithmetic make logic harder to follow without context.","tokens":232,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
