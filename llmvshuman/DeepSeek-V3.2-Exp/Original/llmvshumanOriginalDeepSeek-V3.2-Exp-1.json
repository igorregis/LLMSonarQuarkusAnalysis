{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and leverages existing method. Portuguese comments aid native speakers but may limit international teams. Method name in Portuguese reduces clarity for non-speakers.","tokens":323,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method names, proper ternary operator usage, and comprehensive documentation in Portuguese explaining behavior and edge cases.","tokens":338,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation is flawed, making it hard to understand and debug.","tokens":886,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and comments but uses Portuguese identifiers which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Logic is straightforward with good variable naming and consistent formatting.","tokens":540,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation explaining the logic. The implementation uses simple arithmetic to calculate the quarter start month efficiently. Method name and comments are in Portuguese but logic is straightforward.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código bem estruturado com comentários claros em português. Lógica direta seguindo regras de ano bissexto. Pode ser simplificado removendo else desnecessário.","tokens":343,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive method name, and simple logic. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of defining PI constant.","tokens":313,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation and simple logic. Variable names are meaningful and formula is standard. Only minor deduction for basic nature.","tokens":308,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward but compensation handling could be better documented for full understanding.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may reduce comprehension for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented.","tokens":354,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
