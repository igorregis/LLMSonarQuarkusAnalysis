{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and leverages existing method. Portuguese comments aid readability but method name in Portuguese may confuse non-native speakers. Logic is clear with modulo operation handling year wrap-around.","tokens":327,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear ternary operator, good method naming, and comprehensive documentation explaining behavior and edge cases.","tokens":334,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation is flawed, making it hard to understand and debug.","tokens":886,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and logic but uses Portuguese identifiers which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Good comments explain complex parts. Variable names are descriptive. Conditional logic is straightforward but font handling could be simplified.","tokens":551,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation explaining the logic. The implementation uses simple arithmetic to calculate the quarter start month efficiently. Method name and comments are in Portuguese but logic is straightforward.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código bem estruturado com comentários claros em português. Lógica direta seguindo regras de ano bissexto. Nome do método descritivo. Ponto perdido por else desnecessário, poderia retornar diretamente a condição.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive method name, and simple logic. Only minor improvement possible by using Math.PI constant instead of defining PI manually.","tokens":314,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation, descriptive variable names, and simple logic. Only minor improvement possible in comment redundancy.","tokens":305,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward using standard math operations. Only minor improvement would be explaining compensation bits in comments.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may limit readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
