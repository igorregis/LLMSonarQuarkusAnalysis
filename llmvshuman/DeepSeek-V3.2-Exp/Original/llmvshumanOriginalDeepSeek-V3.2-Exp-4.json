{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear method naming and simple logic. The modulo operation handles month wrapping correctly. Documentation is comprehensive but in Portuguese which may limit some readers.","tokens":325,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method names, proper ternary operator usage, and comprehensive javadoc explaining behavior and edge cases. Only minor deduction for using 0.0d instead of just 0.0.","tokens":356,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation is flawed, making it hard to understand and verify correctness.","tokens":887,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear variable names and logical structure. Portuguese comments help but may limit international teams. Some complex font logic and inline comments disrupt flow.","tokens":538,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation. Simple mathematical logic divides months into quarters. Method name and comments make purpose obvious. Only minor improvement possible in variable naming.","tokens":355,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código bem estruturado com comentário claro em português explicando a lógica. Método simples e direto com condicional que segue exatamente a regra de anos bissextos. Nome do método é descritivo e a lógica é fácil de entender.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive variable names, and logical structure. Only minor improvement possible by using Math.PI constant instead of defining PI manually.","tokens":314,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation, meaningful variable names, and simple logic. Only minor improvement possible in comment conciseness.","tokens":307,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good variable names and comments in Portuguese. Logic is straightforward but compensation handling adds slight complexity.","tokens":304,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
