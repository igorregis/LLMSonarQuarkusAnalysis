{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear method naming and simple logic. The modulo operation handles month wrapping correctly. Documentation is comprehensive but method relies on another method soma which isn\u0027t shown.","tokens":328,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method names, proper ternary operator usage, and comprehensive documentation explaining behavior and edge cases. Only minor deduction for using 0.0d instead of 0.0.","tokens":353,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation is flawed, making it hard to understand and verify correctness.","tokens":887,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and comments but uses Portuguese identifiers which reduces readability for international teams. Logic is straightforward with good variable naming despite language barrier.","tokens":537,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation. Logic is concise using integer division to calculate quarter start month. Method name and comments make purpose immediately understandable.","tokens":352,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código claro com documentação em português. Lógica bem estruturada seguindo regras de ano bissexto. Podería ser mais conciso retornando diretamente a expressão booleana.","tokens":348,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, good variable names, and logical structure. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of defining PI constant.","tokens":313,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation and simple logic. Variable names are meaningful and formula is standard. Only minor improvement possible in comment conciseness.","tokens":311,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward using standard math operations. Only minor deduction for non-English comments which may reduce international readability.","tokens":317,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
