{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and readable with clear method naming and simple logic. The modulo operation handles year wrapping efficiently. Documentation is comprehensive but method relies on another method which may require context.","tokens":327,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method names, proper ternary operator usage, and comprehensive documentation in Portuguese explaining behavior and edge cases.","tokens":338,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation deviates from specification. Hard to follow due to poor structure and bugs.","tokens":890,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and comments but uses Portuguese identifiers which reduces readability for international teams. Logic is straightforward with good variable naming in Portuguese. Some complex font handling but overall comprehensible.","tokens":545,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation. Logic is concise using integer division to calculate quarter start month. Method name and comments make purpose immediately understandable.","tokens":352,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código bem estruturado com comentários claros em português. Lógica direta seguindo regra de ano bissexto. Poderiam simplificar retorno removendo if-else desnecessário.","tokens":347,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive method name, and simple logic. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of defining PI constant.","tokens":313,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation and simple logic. Variable names are meaningful and formula is standard. Only minor deduction for basic comments that repeat obvious code.","tokens":312,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese. Method logic is straightforward for combining statistics. Minor deduction for lack of explanation on compensation mechanism which may require additional context.","tokens":314,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may limit readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
