{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and leverages existing method. Good naming and documentation. Minor deduction for potential confusion with negative modulo behavior.","tokens":315,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear method names, proper ternary operator usage, and comprehensive documentation explaining behavior and edge cases.","tokens":336,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation is flawed, making it hard to understand and verify correctness.","tokens":887,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and logic but uses Portuguese identifiers which reduces readability for international teams. Comments are helpful but mixed language creates inconsistency. Method organization is logical with good variable naming in Portuguese.","tokens":546,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation explaining the logic. The implementation uses simple arithmetic to calculate the quarter start month efficiently. Only minor improvement would be clarifying ENUMS array purpose.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código claro com documentação em português. Lógica bem estruturada seguindo regras de ano bissexto. Podería ser mais conciso retornando diretamente a expressão booleana.","tokens":348,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, good variable names, and simple logic. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of defining PI constant.","tokens":313,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation, meaningful variable names, and simple logic. Only minor improvement possible in comment conciseness.","tokens":307,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward but compensation handling could be better documented for full understanding.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may limit readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
