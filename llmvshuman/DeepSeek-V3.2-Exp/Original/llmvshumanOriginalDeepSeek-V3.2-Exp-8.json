{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and leverages existing method. Portuguese comments aid readability but method name could be more descriptive. Logic is clear with modulo operation handling year wrap-around.","tokens":324,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear ternary operator. Method names are descriptive and documentation is comprehensive. Only minor improvement would be using 0.0 instead of 0.0d for consistency.","tokens":350,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm is hard to follow despite comments. The implementation does not correctly implement the modulo 10 specification described.","tokens":894,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear variable names and logical structure. Portuguese comments help but may confuse non-speakers. Some complex font logic and inline comments disrupt flow.","tokens":539,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation. Logic is concise using integer division to calculate quarter start month. Method name and comments make purpose immediately understandable.","tokens":352,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código claro e bem documentado. A lógica do ano bissexto é implementada corretamente com comentários explicativos em português. A estrutura condicional é simples e fácil de entender. Ponto perdido apenas por poder simplificar o retorno direto da expressão booleana.","tokens":365,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive variable names, and logical structure. Only minor improvement possible by using Math.PI constant instead of defining PI manually.","tokens":314,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation and simple logic. Variable names are meaningful and formula is standard. Only minor deduction for basic comments stating the obvious.","tokens":311,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward but compensation handling could be slightly confusing without deeper context.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may limit readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
