{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and leverages existing method. Good naming and documentation. Minor deduction for potential confusion with negative modulo behavior in Java.","tokens":317,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear ternary operator, good method naming, and comprehensive documentation explaining behavior and edge cases. Only minor improvement possible in documentation formatting.","tokens":342,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has logical errors like array index issues and incorrect digit sum calculation. Variable names are unclear and algorithm implementation deviates from the specification. Hard to follow the intended modulo 10 calculation.","tokens":891,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear variable names and logical structure. Portuguese comments help but may limit international teams. Some complex font logic and inline comments disrupt flow slightly.","tokens":539,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation explaining the logic. The implementation uses simple arithmetic to calculate the quarter start month efficiently. Method name and comments are in Portuguese but logic is straightforward.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código claro com documentação em português. Lógica bem estruturada seguindo regra de anos bissextos. Podería ser mais conciso retornando diretamente a expressão booleana.","tokens":348,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive variable names, and logical structure. Only minor improvement would be using Math.PI instead of defining PI constant.","tokens":313,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear Portuguese documentation, descriptive variable names, and simple logic. Only minor improvement possible in comment conciseness.","tokens":307,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese explaining the combine operation. Method logic is straightforward but compensation handling could be better documented for full understanding.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear logic for month calculation. Method name and comments are in Portuguese which may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Type casting and modulo operations are well implemented but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
