{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is obfuscated with unnecessary negation and modulo operations.","tokens":215,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names are in Portuguese which may hinder non-speakers but the ternary operator is clear and concise making the logic easy to follow","tokens":225,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming, unclear algorithm purpose, complex nested operations, and confusing loop conditions make this code very difficult to understand and maintain.","tokens":436,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers. No comments or meaningful structure to aid comprehension.","tokens":464,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall hard to understand purpose.","tokens":219,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names and purpose. Minor deduction for magic number instead of Math.PI constant.","tokens":221,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive method name.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words making code extremely difficult to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming conventions despite simple mathematical operations.","tokens":285,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (oregano, nozMoscada, pimentaCaiena). Method name menta is unclear. Logic is obfuscated with magic numbers. Requires significant effort to understand purpose.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
