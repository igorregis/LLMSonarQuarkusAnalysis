{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless in Portuguese, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":214,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names are unclear but ternary operator is concise and logic is straightforward. Default return for division by zero is handled correctly.","tokens":224,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming, unclear algorithm purpose, complex nested operations, and confusing loop conditions make this code very difficult to understand and maintain.","tokens":436,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers. No comments or context provided.","tokens":461,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear. Array pimentaCaiena name is cryptic. Logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall very difficult to understand purpose.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final for constant PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility method with obvious purpose.","tokens":228,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names.","tokens":220,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words unrelated to their function making code extremely difficult to understand No comments or documentation provided","tokens":281,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is obscured by poor naming and unnecessary arithmetic operations. Code purpose is unclear without context.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
