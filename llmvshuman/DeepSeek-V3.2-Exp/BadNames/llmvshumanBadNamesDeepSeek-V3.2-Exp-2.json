{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless, making the code hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming and unnecessary negation.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method names are unclear but ternary operator is concise. Logic is straightforward but readability suffers from non-descriptive naming.","tokens":222,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and unclear algorithm purpose. Complex nested operations with magic numbers. Code structure is confusing and lacks documentation making it hard to understand.","tokens":438,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations.","tokens":458,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall hard to understand purpose and implementation.","tokens":221,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final constant for PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility method with obvious purpose.","tokens":228,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words unrelated to their function, making code extremely difficult to understand without context. Logic is obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":288,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is obscured by arbitrary constants and modulo operations. Code purpose is completely unclear without context.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
