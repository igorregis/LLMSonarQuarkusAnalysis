{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless in Portuguese, making the code hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names are in Portuguese which may hinder non-speakers but the ternary operator is clear and concise making logic easy to follow","tokens":224,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming, unclear algorithm purpose, complex nested operations, and confusing loop conditions make this code very difficult to understand and maintain.","tokens":436,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations like feijaoVerde.nextFloat().","tokens":466,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall hard to understand purpose.","tokens":219,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by removing redundant if-else and directly returning the boolean expression.","tokens":243,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final for constant PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility method with obvious purpose.","tokens":228,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic. Method name could be more descriptive but overall easy to understand.","tokens":216,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words making code extremely hard to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming despite simple mathematical operations.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (oregano, nozMoscada, pimentaCaiena). Method name menta is unclear. Logic is obfuscated with magic numbers 12. No comments explaining the purpose.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
