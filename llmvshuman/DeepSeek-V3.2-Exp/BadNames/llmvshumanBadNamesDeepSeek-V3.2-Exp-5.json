{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless making the code very hard to understand The logic is simple but requires mental mapping to decipher","tokens":209,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names are unclear but ternary operator is concise and logic is straightforward. Readability is good but naming could be improved.","tokens":224,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and unclear algorithm purpose. Complex nested operations with magic numbers. Code structure is confusing with multiple loops and array manipulations that are hard to follow.","tokens":441,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations.","tokens":458,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name tomilho is unclear. Array pimentaCaiena name is cryptic. Logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall very hard to understand purpose.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final constant for PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility and straightforward logic.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive method name.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words unrelated to their function making code extremely difficult to understand No comments or documentation provided","tokens":281,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is obscured by poor naming and unnecessary arithmetic operations. Code requires significant mental effort to understand its purpose.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
