{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless in Portuguese, making the code hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese may confuse non-speakers, but ternary operator and logic are clear and concise. Good use of final and consistent formatting.","tokens":228,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming, unclear algorithm purpose, complex nested operations, and confusing loop conditions make this code very difficult to understand","tokens":433,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations.","tokens":458,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name is unclear and array name is cryptic. Logic is simple but requires understanding of ordinal division and array indexing. Overall readability is poor due to naming.","tokens":220,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and clear with good variable naming. Uses final for constant but could use Math.PI for better precision. Single responsibility makes it easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable and simple. Clear variable names and straightforward formula for triangle area calculation. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless making code extremely hard to understand. Logic combines statistics but purpose is unclear due to poor naming conventions.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is obfuscated with arbitrary constants. Requires significant effort to understand the actual month calculation.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
