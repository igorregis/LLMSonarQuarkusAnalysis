{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese may confuse non-native speakers, but the ternary operator is clear and concise for handling division by zero.","tokens":224,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming, unclear algorithm purpose, complex nested operations, and confusing loop conditions make this code very difficult to understand and maintain.","tokens":436,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers. No comments or structure to aid comprehension.","tokens":463,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name is unclear and misleading. Array name pimentaCaiena is cryptic. Logic is hard to follow without context. Overall very difficult to understand purpose.","tokens":221,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final constant for PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility and straightforward logic.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive method name.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words making code extremely hard to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming despite simple mathematical operations.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is unclear without context. Portuguese names don\u0027t help international readability. Only positive is compact structure.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
