{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless in Portuguese, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese reduce readability for non speakers but ternary operator and logic are clear and concise","tokens":218,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and unclear algorithm purpose. Complex nested operations with magic numbers make code hard to understand. Array indexing is confusing and error-prone.","tokens":438,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations.","tokens":458,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall hard to understand purpose.","tokens":219,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and clear with good variable naming. Uses final for constant. Could improve with Math.PI instead of custom constant and better method name.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Simple and clear method calculating area of a triangle. Good naming and structure, but parameter order (b,a) could be more intuitive as (base,height).","tokens":224,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless making code extremely hard to understand. No comments or documentation. Logic is obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless making code very hard to understand. Method name menta is unclear. Logic requires mental mapping of arbitrary names to actual concepts.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
