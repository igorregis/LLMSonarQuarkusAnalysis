{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names are in Portuguese which may hinder non-speakers but the ternary operator is clear and concise making the logic easy to follow","tokens":225,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and unclear algorithm purpose. Complex nested operations with magic numbers. Code structure is confusing and lacks documentation making it hard to understand.","tokens":438,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear operations.","tokens":459,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall poor readability despite short code.","tokens":220,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and clear with good variable naming. Uses final for constant but could use Math.PI for better precision. Single responsibility makes it easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic for calculating area of a triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names.","tokens":219,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words making code extremely hard to understand. No comments or documentation. Logic is unclear despite simple operations.","tokens":285,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor variable naming makes code very hard to understand. Method and variable names are meaningless Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose. Logic is obfuscated despite simple modulo arithmetic.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
