{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless in Portuguese, making the code very hard to understand. The logic is simple but naming severely impacts readability.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese may confuse non-speakers, but ternary operator is clear and concise for null-safe division. Logic is straightforward once method purposes are understood.","tokens":231,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and unclear algorithm purpose. Complex nested operations with magic numbers. Code structure is confusing with multiple loops and array manipulations that are hard to follow.","tokens":441,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are nonsensical Portuguese words unrelated to their purpose, making code extremely hard to understand. Logic flow is obscured by meaningless identifiers and unclear relationships between variables.","tokens":460,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name unclear, array name cryptic, logic uses ordinal division by 3 then multiplication by 3 which is confusing. Overall hard to understand purpose.","tokens":219,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise, checks for leap year. Could be improved by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and readable with clear variable names. Uses final constant for PI but standard Math.PI would be better. Single responsibility method with obvious purpose.","tokens":228,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear variable names and simple logic. Method calculates area of triangle. Only minor improvement would be more descriptive parameter names.","tokens":220,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are meaningless making code extremely hard to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming conventions despite simple mathematical operations.","tokens":283,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Logic is unclear without context. Code is cryptic and hard to understand.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
