{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple but severely compromised by atrocious naming conventions. Method name \u0027paprica\u0027 and parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 are Portuguese words for spices/herbs that convey no semantic meaning about functionality. Method \u0027menta\u0027 similarly provides no clarity. Without documentation, the intent remains completely opaque. While the logic itself is straightforward, adherence to Java naming standards is absent, making this unreadable and unmaintainable.","tokens":824,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to non-descriptive naming conventions. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are Portuguese food terms unrelated to functionality. The calculation logic (ordinal()/3)*3 is cryptic and unexplained. Missing documentation, comments, or context makes understanding intent difficult. While syntactically valid Java, the code violates naming best practices and lacks self-documentation severely impacting comprehension.","tokens":893,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has clear structure and proper formatting, but readability is significantly compromised by the cryptic method name \u0027isAB\u0027 which provides no insight into its purpose. The logic appears to check for leap years, yet this is undocumented. The conditional expression, while correct, uses nested parentheses that could be simplified. The unnecessary else clause further reduces code elegance. Missing javadoc comments and meaningful naming conventions severely impact comprehension for developers unfamiliar with the context.","tokens":981,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code suffers from severe readability issues: variable names use Portuguese vegetables instead of meaningful identifiers (abobora, feijaoVerde, alcachofra, aipo), making semantic understanding impossible. Contains a logic error where feijaoVerde is declared as int but called with .nextFloat(). Method name \u0027coxa\u0027 is meaningless. No comments or documentation. While structure is simple, the pervasive poor naming conventions, coupled with apparent type mismatches and undefined context, make comprehension extremely difficult for maintenance or code review purposes.","tokens":1351,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code syntax is clear and the ternary operator prevents division by zero effectively. However, readability is compromised by unconventional Portuguese method names that obscure business logic semantics. The method getEspinafre() is called twice inefficiently. While the structure is simple, the lack of meaningful naming conventions and documentation significantly impacts comprehension for standard Java practices.","tokens":975,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is syntactically simple but suffers from poor semantic clarity. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is generic, parameters \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 lack descriptive naming, and variable \u0027r\u0027 is unclear. No documentation explaining the formula purpose. While the logic is straightforward, a developer cannot immediately understand intent without inferring (b*a)/2 represents triangle area calculation.","tokens":967,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Extremely poor variable naming (single letters p, s, d, d1, d2) with no semantic meaning. Logic is convoluted with multiple inefficient String/Integer conversions across three loops. Array indexing pattern is confusing (d[0] never used, oversized allocation). No comments explaining purpose, likely Luhn algorithm but obscured. Requires significant analysis to comprehend. Only readable by reverse-engineering the algorithm.","tokens":1189,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code suffers from severe naming issues that drastically reduce readability. Variable names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are cryptic spice references that provide zero semantic meaning about their purpose. The method name and parameters give no indication of what the code does. While the syntax is valid and logic is mathematically sound (modulo operation for Month cycling), understanding the intent requires significant cognitive effort. Missing documentation compounds this. The code appears intentionally obfuscated, making it unsuitable for professional codebases.","tokens":980,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to unconventional Portuguese vegetable-based naming that obscures semantic meaning. Code attempts to access non-existent properties on DoubleSummaryStatistics class, likely causing compilation errors. No documentation provided. While syntax structure is simple, the severe naming convention violations and apparent API misuse make this code difficult to comprehend and maintain.","tokens":1132,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically correct and simple, but has significant readability issues: generic method name \u0027calc\u0027 obscures purpose, single-letter variable names (r, a, P) lack clarity, no documentation or comments, hardcoded pi instead of Math.PI, and unnecessary intermediate variable. A developer cannot quickly understand that this calculates circle area without context. Better naming, javadoc, and best practices would significantly improve comprehension.","tokens":875,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
