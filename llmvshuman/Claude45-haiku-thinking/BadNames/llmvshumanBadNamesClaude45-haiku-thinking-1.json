{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has severe readability issues due to meaningless variable and method names using Portuguese herbs/spices (paprica, menta, alecrim) that provide no semantic meaning. Without documentation or seeing the menta method, the purpose is unclear. While the logic itself is simple (modulo 12 operation), the naming convention makes it extremely difficult to understand intent. Professional naming standards are completely absent, making maintenance and comprehension very challenging.","tokens":850,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are meaningless Portuguese terms unrelated to functionality. Magic number 3 lacks explanation. The algorithmic intent of (ordinal()/3)*3 is obscure without documentation. Non-standard naming violates Java conventions. While syntactically simple, semantic confusion makes comprehension very difficult without external context.","tokens":902,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple but lacks clarity. Method and variable names are vague: \u0027calc\u0027 doesnt indicate purpose, parameters \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 are unexplained, and \u0027r\u0027 is ambiguous. The logic appears to calculate triangle area but no documentation confirms this. Missing JavaDoc, no input validation, and the intermediate variable \u0027r\u0027 is unnecessary. While easy to parse syntactically, the poor naming conventions and absence of context severely hamper comprehension of intent and use cases.","tokens":852,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Problematic readability due to non-descriptive naming: method \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 lack clarity about purpose. Logic appears to check leap years but intent is unclear. If-else structure is unnecessarily verbose - could be simplified to return statement directly. No documentation or comments explaining the algorithm. Code works but poor naming severely impacts maintainability and comprehension for new developers.","tokens":856,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is straightforward and easy to follow logically. However, readability is impacted by non-descriptive variable names (\u0027a\u0027 instead of \u0027area\u0027, \u0027r\u0027 for radius, generic \u0027calc\u0027 method name). Using hardcoded Pi instead of Math.PI constant is suboptimal. The simplified structure aids comprehension, but lack of documentation and better naming conventions prevents a higher score.","tokens":826,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severe readability issues: variable names are Portuguese food items (abobora, inhame, feijaoVerde) unrelated to functionality, causing confusion. Critical bug: feijaoVerde declared as int but used with nextFloat() method. Unclear constants like GRAO_DE_BICO and MILHOS. Logic flow is convoluted with alternating colors and unclear purposes. No meaningful identifiers make code intent impossible to understand. Poor naming conventions violate professional standards.","tokens":1200,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severely compromised readability due to misleading variable names using spice terms (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that obscure actual purpose. Method name \u0027menta\u0027 is non-descriptive. No comments explain the modulo arithmetic logic or the context of ordinal() call. While the code structure is simple, the naming conventions actively obstruct understanding and violate Java standards. Appears to be either obfuscated or demonstrates extremely poor naming practices.","tokens":930,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability. Variable and method names use unrelated Portuguese vegetable terms (gengibre, pimenta, batata, abobora) that bear no semantic relationship to their purpose. The DoubleSummaryStatistics class lacks the referenced fields (batata, salsa, tomate, pepino), suggesting compilation errors. No documentation explaining intent. The code logic is obscure and violates fundamental naming conventions. Only slightly comprehensible due to visible mathematical operations.","tokens":1140,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severe readability issues due to extremely poor naming conventions. Method names using Portuguese vegetable terms (brocolis, espinafre, jaca) as identifiers are unprofessional and confusing. No documentation explaining purpose or relationships. While logic is syntactically correct and prevents division by zero, semantic meaning is completely obscured. Violates basic Java naming standards. Only positive: ternary operator prevents runtime errors.","tokens":1012,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Codigo com legibilidade extremamente baixa devido a nomes de variaveis criticas (p, s, d, n, d1, d2). Ausencia total de comentarios explicativos. Logica complexa com multiplas conversoes String-Integer desnecessarias. Array inicializado incorretamente com indice zero nunca utilizado. Falta de tratamento de erros e validacao de entrada. Embora sintaticamente correto, requer esforco cognitivo significativo para compreender a intencao do metodo, violando principios basicos de qualidade de codigo.","tokens":1126,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
