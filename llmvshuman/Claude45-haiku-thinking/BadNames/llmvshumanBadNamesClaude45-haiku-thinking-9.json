{"score":"2","reasoning":"Critical readability issues: (1) Variable names use meaningless Portuguese vegetable terms making semantic understanding nearly impossible; (2) Logical error: \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027 is uninitialized before use; (3) Type mismatch: calling nextFloat() on an int variable; (4) Method and class purposes are unclear. While basic control flow structure exists, professional code standards are severely violated.","tokens":1371,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severe readability issues due to cryptic naming conventions. Method \u0027tomilho\u0027 (thyme) and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) are semantically meaningless for code logic. Array indexing logic with division/multiplication by 3 lacks explanation. Portuguese names mixed with Java/Month type create confusion. No comments or documentation. While syntactically correct, comprehension requires significant context or reverse-engineering effort.","tokens":875,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic single-letter variable names (p, s, d, n, d1, d2), unclear method name \u0027dv\u0027, and absence of documentation. The algorithm logic is obscured by complex string/integer conversions and confusing array indexing. While structurally simple, the code lacks semantic clarity and requires significant effort to comprehend its purpose, likely implementing Luhn validation.","tokens":1326,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has clear syntax and correct leap year logic, but suffers from poor naming conventions. The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are vague and don\u0027t convey purpose. The unnecessary else clause adds verbosity. While technically readable, the lack of descriptive naming and documentation significantly hampers comprehension for developers unfamiliar with the code\u0027s intent.","tokens":732,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple and easy to follow, demonstrating basic Java structure. However, readability is hindered by generic naming: the method name \u0027calc\u0027 lacks clarity about its purpose, variable \u0027a\u0027 doesn\u0027t indicate it represents area, and \u0027r\u0027 is minimally descriptive. While the PI constant is appropriately defined, the absence of documentation or comments explaining the circle area calculation reduces comprehension. Better naming conventions (calculateCircleArea, radius, area) and JavaDoc would significantly improve clarity.","tokens":769,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Syntactically clear but semantically confusing. Method name getBrocolis() and variable names getEspinafre(), getJaca() use Portuguese food names that obscure business logic. Division calculation intent is unclear without context. Poor naming conventions severely harm maintainability and comprehension despite simple ternary operator structure with proper null-safety.","tokens":858,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to non-semantic variable and method names using Portuguese herb/spice terms (paprica, menta, alecrim) that obscure intent. While the logic is syntactically simple, the cryptic naming convention makes comprehension difficult. Mixing Portuguese with Java code is unconventional. No comments explaining the apparent month calculation. Severe semantic obfuscation despite straightforward implementation.","tokens":929,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has severe readability issues. Variable and method names use Portuguese vegetable words (gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, berinjela) that provide no semantic meaning about the code\u0027s purpose. Additionally, the parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics doesn\u0027t match the accessed fields, creating confusion about the actual intent. There are no comments explaining the logic, making it impossible to understand what calculations are performed. While syntactically valid, the code lacks any meaningful naming conventions or documentation essential for comprehension and maintenance.","tokens":1011,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple and easy to mechanically follow, but suffers from severe comprehension issues. Single-letter variable names (b, a, r) lack semantic meaning, the generic function name \u0027calc\u0027 provides no context about what calculation is performed, and there are no comments or JavaDoc. While the logic (multiplying two numbers and dividing by 2) is straightforward, a reader cannot understand the actual purpose or intent without external context. Professional standards recommend descriptive naming conventions and documentation for maintainability.","tokens":893,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to terrible naming conventions. Method name \u0027menta\u0027, variable names like \u0027oregano\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (spice ingredients in Portuguese) are intentionally misleading and provide zero semantic meaning. The logic for month calculation is obscured by these cryptic names. No comments explain purpose. Missing context for \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 array. Magic numbers (12) unexplained. Violates all Java naming standards making code almost incomprehensible on first encounter.","tokens":1085,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
