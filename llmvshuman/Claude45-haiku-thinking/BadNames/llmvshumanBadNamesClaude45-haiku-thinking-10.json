{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple and the arithmetic is straightforward, but readability is severely compromised by poor naming conventions. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is overly generic, parameters \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 lack descriptive meaning, and variable \u0027r\u0027 doesn\u0027t indicate its purpose. The formula suggests a specific calculation (possibly triangle area), but without documentation or meaningful names, the intent is unclear. Professional standards require better naming and JavaDoc comments.","tokens":860,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"O codigo e simples e facil de acompanhar logicamente, mas apresenta problemas de legibilidade. Nomes de variavel sao genricos (r, a, P) sem descrever claramente suas funcoes. Falta documentacao explicando que calcula area de circulo. O uso de PI hardcoded em vez de Math.PI e uma pratica inadequada. A ausencia de javadoc e comentarios reduz compreensao. Embora o raciocinio seja direto, a falta de nomenclatura descritiva e boas praticas diminui a qualidade geral.","tokens":862,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Extremely cryptic variable names (p, s, d, d1, d2, n) severely impair comprehension. Code lacks documentation explaining its purpose, which appears to be the Luhn algorithm. While the core logic flow is relatively straightforward, understanding requires careful analysis. String operations are inefficient and convoluted. Poor adherence to professional code quality standards for maintainability.","tokens":1907,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has significant readability issues: Portuguese variable names (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) in what appears to be English codebase create confusion; method purpose is unclear; cryptic arithmetic logic (ordinal()/3)*3 lacks explanation; no comments present; variable names fail to convey intent or semantics; unclear relationship between array indexing and Month return type. Syntax is correct but comprehension is severely hindered by poor naming conventions and missing documentation.","tokens":782,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severely compromised readability due to meaningless variable names (Portuguese food terms: abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, etc.), making code intent completely unclear. Contains a critical logic error: feijaoVerde is uninitialized but used as an object (feijaoVerde.nextFloat()). No documentation or comments. Method name \u0027coxa\u0027 lacks context. The naming convention violates Java standards entirely, mixing Portuguese with English. While syntactically valid, the semantic incomprehensibility makes maintenance and understanding nearly impossible.","tokens":1195,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses intentionally obscured variable names with spice/herb terminology (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) instead of meaningful identifiers. While the underlying logic appears to be simple month arithmetic with modulo operations, the naming makes comprehension extremely difficult. There are no comments, the method purpose is unclear, and it violates standard Java naming conventions. This appears to be deliberately obfuscated code, severely impacting readability and maintainability despite the relatively straightforward algorithmic intent.","tokens":958,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to extremely non-descriptive naming conventions. Variable names \u0027alecrim\u0027, \u0027paprica\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027 are Portuguese herb names with no semantic meaning in code context. Method purpose is unclear without documentation. Return type \u0027Month\u0027 suggests calendar logic, but the negation and modulo operation lacks explanation. Syntax is correct and structure is simple, but comprehension requires external context. Violates Java naming best practices significantly.","tokens":963,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"O codigo tem sintaxe clara e logica booleana bem formatada, mas severamente comprometido pela nomenclatura inadequada. O nome do metodo \u0027isAB\u0027 e parametro \u0027a\u0027 sao genéricos e nao revelam intencao. Falta documentacao JavaDoc. A estrutura if-else e desnecessaria. Embora o algoritmo de ano bissexto seja compreensivel a engenheiros experientes, a falta de contexto e nomes significativos reduz significativamente a legibilidade geral do codigo.","tokens":1072,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"While syntactically simple and properly formatted, this code severely compromises readability through Portuguese method names that violate Java conventions. The semantic logic is nonsensical - calculating broccoli as jackfruit divided by spinach lacks business sense. Method purpose is unclear without documentation. Though the ternary operator is correctly used with zero-division handling, the overall comprehension is significantly hindered by poor naming practices and undefined intent.","tokens":1022,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code exhibits severe readability issues: nonsensical variable names using Portuguese food terms (batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, berinjela) that convey no semantic meaning; method name gengibre lacks clarity; parameter pimenta and field access patterns dont align with standard DoubleSummaryStatistics API; no documentation or comments explaining intent; violates Java naming conventions; logic appears arbitrary without context.
