{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has critical readability issues: method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is meaningless and parameter \u0027a\u0027 is uninformative. While the leap year logic is recognizable to experienced developers, poor naming makes intent unclear. The if-else structure returning true/false is unnecessarily verbose and could be simplified. No documentation explains purpose. Variable naming violates best practices, severely impacting comprehension for code maintainability and review.","tokens":905,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code suffers from severely poor naming conventions (single-letter variables p, s, d, n, d1, d2 convey no meaning). Algorithm lacks any documentation making purpose unclear. Confusing array indexing with intentional null at index 0. Inefficient repeated String/Integer conversions. No input validation or error handling. While syntactically valid, maintainability and comprehension are severely compromised.","tokens":1192,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"While the code logic is simple and structurally easy to follow, readability is severely compromised by poor naming conventions. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 and variable names \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027 are cryptic and provide no semantic meaning. Absent documentation makes it unclear that this likely calculates triangle area. Single-letter parameters violate Java naming standards. The code lacks JavaDoc comments explaining purpose and parameters. Despite syntactic simplicity, the lack of context and meaningful identifiers significantly hampers comprehension.","tokens":897,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code syntax is simple and straightforward, but readability is severely compromised by poor naming conventions. Method names (paprica, menta) and parameter names (alecrim) are obscure and non-descriptive, violating Java naming standards. The relationship between the modulo operation and Month return type is unclear without context. No documentation or comments explain the purpose. While the logic itself is simple, the semantic confusion from naming makes comprehension difficult.","tokens":886,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code readability is severely compromised by incomprehensible variable naming using Portuguese food/vegetable terms (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, inhame, etc.), making code intent completely unclear. Additionally, the code contains critical runtime errors: feijaoVerde is uninitialized yet called with .nextFloat() method. Logic flow is obscured and field references are unexplained. While basic Java structure exists, the naming obfuscation and bugs make comprehension extremely difficult.","tokens":1349,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is syntactically clean with proper zero-division handling, but readability is significantly compromised by cryptic method names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca) that don\u0027t convey business meaning or semantic intent. While the ternary logic is straightforward, the relationships between these vegetable-named methods remain unclear, making maintenance and comprehension difficult. Lacks explanatory comments for non-obvious calculations.","tokens":1294,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"While syntactically valid and concise, this code exhibits severe comprehension issues. Variable and method names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) use Portuguese spice names that are semantically misleading and provide zero insight into functionality. The code appears to handle month cycling based on the modulo 12 operations and ordinal() call, but the actual purpose is obscured. Missing documentation, hardcoded magic numbers, and implicit assumptions about enum context further degrade readability. This represents unprofessional naming practices that significantly hamper code understanding and maintenance.","tokens":1002,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use unrelated Portuguese words lacking semantic meaning. Magic number 3 is unexplained. The mathematical operation (ordinal()/3)*3 is cryptic without documentation. No comments clarify intent. Violates Java naming conventions and self-documenting code principles. Though syntactically valid, comprehension requires significant effort and context.","tokens":910,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability. Method and variable names are all Portuguese vegetable/herb terms that convey no semantic meaning. Code violates fundamental naming conventions using \u0027gengibre\u0027, \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, etc. The purpose is incomprehensible without extensive documentation. Fields named after vegetables don\u0027t match DoubleSummaryStatistics API. Logic flow is unclear. This code would be unmaintainable in production environments despite being syntactically correct.","tokens":1127,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is syntactically simple and straightforward, however it suffers from poor naming conventions. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is generic, variable names \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027, and \u0027P\u0027 lack clarity, and the hardcoded Pi value instead of Math.PI is a code smell. Missing JavaDoc documentation. While basic logic is easy to follow, comprehension of purpose requires inference. A senior engineer would expect better practices and clarity.","tokens":1075,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
