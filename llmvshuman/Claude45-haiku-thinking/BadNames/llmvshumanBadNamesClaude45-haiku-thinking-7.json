{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has clean syntax and simple logic, making it technically readable. However, comprehension is significantly hindered by poor naming conventions: parameter names \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 lack semantic meaning, the method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too generic, and there is no JavaDoc documentation. The intermediate variable \u0027r\u0027 is unnecessary. A senior engineer would immediately identify these issues as violating best practices for maintainability and code clarity.","tokens":798,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code logic is clear and the conditional structure is well-organized with proper parentheses. However, readability is significantly hampered by poor naming conventions: \u0027isAB\u0027 is cryptic and doesn\u0027t indicate the method\u0027s purpose, and parameter \u0027a\u0027 lacks clarity. Missing Javadoc documentation compounds comprehension issues. The if-else block could be simplified to a single return statement. The logic appears to check leap years but requires domain knowledge to decipher. Better naming like \u0027isLeapYear\u0027 and \u0027year\u0027, plus documentation, would substantially improve readability.","tokens":909,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple but severely compromises readability through poor naming conventions. Method names paprica and menta, along with parameter alecrim, are Portuguese herb names that provide no semantic meaning. Without external context or method documentation, the purpose is unclear. While the logic is straightforward, the lack of meaningful identifiers and documentation makes comprehension difficult for most developers.","tokens":890,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically correct and the ternary operator properly handles division by zero. However, readability is significantly compromised by cryptic Portuguese vegetable-based method names (brocolis, espinafre, jaca) that obscure the actual business logic. Without documentation, the purpose of this calculation remains unclear, making maintenance difficult. Method names should reflect their intent, not arbitrary terms. The logic structure is sound, but semantic clarity is poor.","tokens":908,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple but severely lacks semantic clarity. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 use Portuguese herb names inappropriately, appearing intentionally obfuscated. The mathematical operation (ordinal()/3)*3 is not self-documenting. No comments explain the purpose. While technically parseable, the true intent is completely unclear, making it difficult to understand what this function actually accomplishes or why these specific calculations matter.","tokens":935,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Severely compromised readability due to cryptic Portuguese vegetable-themed variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde, inhame, alcachofra) that provide no semantic meaning. Critical bugs present: feijaoVerde declared as int but used with .nextFloat() method, causing compilation/runtime errors. Multiple undefined external references cloud context. Absence of documentation and comments. While structure is moderately organized, the naming convention makes comprehension nearly impossible for most developers and violates fundamental coding standards.","tokens":1220,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code suffers from extremely poor naming conventions using Portuguese spice names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that obscure intent and violate professional standards. Logic itself is simple modulo arithmetic, but readability is severely compromised by cryptic identifiers, absence of documentation, and unclear purpose. Variable names provide no semantic meaning, making comprehension difficult without external context.","tokens":1009,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code suffers from severe readability issues: single-letter variable names (p, s, d, n) lack semantic meaning, no comments explain intent, complex nested operations obscure logic flow. While syntactically correct, the function appears to implement a check digit algorithm but this is not evident. Poor naming and lack of documentation make comprehension difficult even for experienced developers. Array indexing and string-to-integer conversions are convoluted.","tokens":1100,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code exhibits severe readability issues: all identifiers use meaningless Portuguese food-related names unrelated to actual purpose. The parameter of type DoubleSummaryStatistics incorrectly accesses non-existent fields like batata, salsa, tomate. Code appears non-functional and unmaintainable. Intent is completely unclear. Poor naming conventions combined with API misuse make comprehension nearly impossible.","tokens":1063,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is functionally simple and easy to trace, but readability suffers from poor naming conventions. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is vague, variable \u0027a\u0027 lacks clarity, and single-letter \u0027P\u0027 is non-descriptive. Hardcoded PI value instead of Math.PI constant, missing Javadoc documentation, and no input validation for negative radius further diminish code quality and maintainability.","tokens":971,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
