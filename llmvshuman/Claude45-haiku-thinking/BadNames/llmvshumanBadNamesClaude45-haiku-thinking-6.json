{"score":"4","reasoning":"While syntactically simple, this code suffers from poor naming conventions that significantly harm comprehension. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is overly generic, parameters \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 lack semantic meaning, and variable \u0027r\u0027 doesn\u0027t indicate its purpose. The code appears to calculate triangle area, but this intent is not clear without documentation. Missing comments and unclear identifiers make maintenance difficult. Better naming like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027, \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027 would substantially improve readability.","tokens":813,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"While syntactically correct and functionally simple, the code suffers from poor naming conventions and lack of documentation. The function name \u0027calc\u0027 is too generic, variable \u0027a\u0027 lacks clarity, \u0027P\u0027 should be \u0027PI\u0027 in uppercase, and hardcoded pi value should use Math.PI. Missing Javadoc comments explaining purpose and parameters further reduces comprehension for future maintainers.","tokens":833,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code exhibits severe readability issues due to intentional obfuscation through misleading variable names using spice-related Portuguese terms (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that lack semantic meaning. While syntactically correct, the method\u0027s purpose is unclear, lacks documentation, and variable names do not self-document functionality. The logic itself is simple but practically incomprehensible without external context about what the array contains and the method\u0027s intended behavior.","tokens":898,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code severely lacks readability due to extremely poor naming conventions. Using Portuguese vegetable/spice names (gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, berinjela) instead of meaningful identifiers makes the purpose completely obscured. Variables like \u0027batata\u0027 and \u0027salsa\u0027 don\u0027t convey their actual purpose. The method logic appears to aggregate statistics but this intent is hidden. The code violates fundamental Java naming standards and best practices, making it nearly impossible to comprehend without external documentation. While operations themselves are simple, the naming scheme renders the code essentially unreadable for any developer unfamiliar with this convention.","tokens":1043,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"This code suffers from severely poor readability. Single-letter variable names (dv, p, s, d, n, d1, d2) provide zero semantic meaning. The algorithm appears to be a checksum calculation but is completely obscured by cryptic naming and lack of documentation. String conversion overhead and convoluted loop logic further diminish comprehension. Maintenance and understanding would require significant reverse-engineering effort. Code structure is syntactically correct but semantically unintelligible.","tokens":1350,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code logic is clear and syntactically correct, appearing to implement leap year validation. However, readability is significantly compromised by poor naming conventions. The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is cryptic and non-descriptive, failing to communicate the method\u0027s purpose. Parameter \u0027a\u0027 is equally vague. Additionally, the if-else-return pattern is unnecessarily verbose and could be simplified to a single return statement. While the conditional logic itself is straightforward, developers must decipher the code to understand functionality.","tokens":919,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has correct syntax and logic, but suffers from extremely poor naming conventions. Using Portuguese vegetable names (brocolis, jaca, espinafre) as method/variable identifiers makes the code semantically meaningless and impossible to understand without context. The actual purpose and data these values represent is completely obscured. While the ternary operator prevents division by zero correctly, the lack of clarity severely impacts comprehension and maintenance.","tokens":898,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and parameter names are cryptic and non-descriptive, severely impacting comprehension. While the mathematical logic is simple and easy to parse, the naming violates fundamental readability principles. Without context about the menta() method or what these herb-themed names represent, understanding the intent requires reverse-engineering. Poor naming conventions make this code difficult to maintain and understand.","tokens":1017,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to nonsensical variable naming using Portuguese vegetable terms (abobora, feijaoVerde, alcachofra) that convey no semantic meaning. Code contains logic errors including uninitialized variable usage and type mismatches. Method purpose is completely unclear, lacks documentation, and violates fundamental naming conventions. Even native speakers would struggle to understand program intent despite syntactic validity.","tokens":1321,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has severe readability issues. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 (thyme in Portuguese) is unrelated to returning a Month. Field \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) is misleading for an array of months. The expression (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is cryptic without context or comments. Variable naming completely obscures intent, making it extremely difficult to understand purpose or logic. Only basic Java syntax structure prevents a score of 1.","tokens":857,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
