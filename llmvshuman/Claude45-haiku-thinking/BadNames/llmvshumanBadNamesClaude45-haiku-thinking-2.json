{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code suffers from severe readability issues due to extremely poor naming conventions. Method names \u0027paprica\u0027 and \u0027menta\u0027, along with parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027, are meaningless Portuguese herb names with no connection to their purpose. This violates fundamental Java naming standards and makes code comprehension nearly impossible without external documentation. While the logic is syntactically correct and simple, the naming obfuscation critically undermines code clarity.","tokens":847,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Codigo simples e logica clara, porem com limitacoes significativas. Nomes de variaveis genericos (r, P, a) e metodo \u0027calc\u0027 vago nao indicam intent do codigo. Uso de constante hardcoded 3.14159 ao inves de Math.PI e ausencia de documentacao ou comentarios reduzem compreensao. Embora seja facil entender a operacao matematica, falta contexto sobre o proposito.","tokens":1179,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code is syntactically valid but severely compromised by incomprehensible variable naming using Portuguese vegetable names instead of meaningful identifiers. This appears deliberately obfuscated, making intent impossible to discern. Logic errors present: uninitialized feijaoVerde used in calculation, and nextFloat() called on int type. Critical professional coding standards violated. Major due diligence red flag indicating either security obfuscation or severe quality issues.","tokens":1283,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is syntactically valid but severely compromises readability through cryptic variable naming using Portuguese spice names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that obscure actual purpose. Parameter semantics are unclear, variable names don\u0027t reflect their function, and the modulo arithmetic logic is non-obvious. No documentation or comments aid comprehension. While an experienced engineer might decode it, the intentional obfuscation makes this code difficult to maintain and understand without significant reverse engineering effort.","tokens":1013,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method has obscure Portuguese variable names without clear purpose. Mathematical logic with ordinal division and multiplication is unexplained. No documentation exists. Variable names tomilho and pimentaCaiena do not convey meaning. Intent is completely opaque despite code brevity, making comprehension extremely difficult.","tokens":1511,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is functionally simple and the mathematical operation is easy to follow. However, readability is hindered by poor naming conventions: generic method name \u0027calc\u0027, single-letter parameters \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027, and abbreviated variable \u0027r\u0027. The purpose of the function is unclear without documentation. Missing Javadoc comments and descriptive names significantly impact maintainability and professional code standards.","tokens":798,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has severe readability issues. Variable names are cryptic (p, s, d, n, d1, d2) making the purpose unclear. The logic appears to implement Luhn algorithm but is unnecessarily convoluted with three separate loops, inefficient string conversions, and confusing array indexing. No comments explain the intent. While syntactically correct, comprehension requires significant effort due to poor naming conventions and complex flow.","tokens":1163,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The logic itself is readable and mathematically correct, but the code has significant clarity issues. The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is completely non-descriptive and doesn\u0027t convey purpose. Parameter name \u0027a\u0027 is too generic. The unnecessary if-else block reduces elegance - could return directly. No comments explain what the leap year algorithm does. While an experienced developer recognizes this as leap year logic, a junior developer would struggle understanding the intent without external documentation.","tokens":907,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code has severe readability issues. All identifiers use Portuguese food names (gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, pepino, alecrim, berinjela) providing zero semantic meaning. Method and variable names violate Java conventions and offer no insight into functionality. Logic structure is clear but completely obfuscated by naming. No documentation. Additionally, DoubleSummaryStatistics usage appears incorrect - this class lacks such fields. Unmaintainable without external context.","tokens":1095,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"While the Java syntax is straightforward with proper use of ternary operator and zero-division check, readability is severely compromised by inappropriate naming conventions. Method names use Portuguese vegetable terms instead of descriptive English identifiers, making the business logic purpose completely opaque. Without documentation, it\u0027s impossible to understand what calculation is being performed. Professional codebases require consistent English naming to ensure maintainability and team comprehension.","tokens":944,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
