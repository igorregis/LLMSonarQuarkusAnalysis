{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to misleading method and variable names that provide no context. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 (thyme) and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) are cryptic and unrelated to functionality. The arithmetic operation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 lacks clarity without comments. No documentation explains the intent. While syntactically valid, significant cognitive effort is required to understand purpose. Violates fundamental naming conventions.","tokens":799,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"While the logic is straightforward, the code suffers from extremely poor naming conventions. Methods and variables use Portuguese words (paprica, alecrim, menta) that are semantically unrelated to their purpose, making the code intentionally obscure. Lack of comments explaining the Month calculation and modulo 12 operation compounds readability issues. The code requires significant cognitive effort to understand intent.","tokens":793,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Critically poor readability. Variable names are random Portuguese food words with no semantic relation to their purpose. Contains type errors and uninitialized variable bugs. Method name is meaningless. No documentation or comments. Class dependencies are unclear. The code is essentially incomprehensible despite simple control flow structure.","tokens":1204,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to meaningless naming conventions. Method and variable names use random Portuguese vegetable words (gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, etc.) that provide no semantic context about functionality. Parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics appears incompatible with custom field access (batata, salsa, tomate). No comments or documentation. The code intent is completely obscured, making comprehension nearly impossible despite simple syntax structure.","tokens":909,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"While the leap year logic is mathematically sound and the if-else structure is straightforward, the code suffers from severely poor naming conventions. The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are cryptic and non-descriptive, offering no hint about the purpose. The absence of documentation or comments compounds this issue. Additionally, the verbose if-else structure could be simplified. A developer would require significant effort to decipher the actual intent, dramatically reducing overall comprehension despite the underlying logic being correct.","tokens":936,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is syntactically correct and handles division-by-zero safely using a ternary operator. However, readability is severely compromised. Method names reference vegetables/fruits in Portuguese that obscure the actual purpose. Without documentation or comments, the semantic meaning is incomprehensible. The relationship between getBrocolis(), getJaca(), and getEspinafre() is cryptic. Variable naming should convey intent, not use metaphorical fruit names. This violates Java naming conventions and makes maintenance difficult.","tokens":993,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is mechanically simple and syntactically correct, but suffers from poor semantic clarity. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too generic, parameters \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 lack meaningful context, and variable \u0027r\u0027 is cryptically abbreviated. The calculation appears to compute triangle area, but this intent is not evident from naming. Missing documentation and unnecessary variable assignment further reduce readability. Better naming conventions would significantly improve comprehension.","tokens":921,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Severely poor readability. Variable names are cryptic and non-descriptive (menta, oregano, nozMoscada, pimentaCaiena - all spice names unrelated to purpose). Method intent is unclear. Magic number 12 repeated without explanation. Relies on unexplained ordinal() method and undefined pimentaCaiena. No comments or documentation. Logic appears to manipulate Month enum but names obscure intent completely. While syntactically valid Java, the code is essentially unmaintainable due to naming choices that provide zero semantic meaning about what the code actually does.","tokens":1043,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Severely compromised readability due to cryptic single-letter variable names (p,s,d,n,d1,d2) that provide no semantic meaning. Method name \u0027dv\u0027 is unexplained and unclear. No comments documenting the algorithm\u0027s purpose, which appears to be a checksum validation. The backward iteration and complex logic flow require significant mental effort to comprehend. While syntactically correct and understandable to experienced developers after careful analysis, it violates fundamental readability principles and lacks any documentation of intent.","tokens":1305,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is syntactically clear and straightforward in its operations, making it technically readable. However, it suffers from poor naming conventions: generic method name \u0027calc\u0027, meaningless variable \u0027a\u0027, and non-standard constant \u0027P\u0027. Uses hardcoded Pi instead of Math.PI, lacks documentation explaining intent, and contains an unnecessary intermediate variable. While a senior developer would recognize it calculates circle area, the poor semantic clarity and code quality practices significantly impact overall comprehension efficiency.","tokens":900,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
