{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027paprica\u0027 and parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 do not convey their purpose, making it hard to understand the intent. The use of \u0027menta\u0027 as a return value is also unclear without context. While the logic is straightforward, better naming conventions and comments would improve readability significantly.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for conditional logic, which enhances readability. The method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 suggests it retrieves a value related to broccoli, while the use of \u0027getEspinafre\u0027 and \u0027getJaca\u0027 indicates a clear relationship between these methods. However, the context of these methods is not provided, which slightly reduces overall comprehension.","tokens":285,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has a clear structure but lacks comments and meaningful variable names, making it harder to understand at first glance. The use of string arrays for calculations is unconventional and can confuse readers. Additionally, the nested loops and conditional logic could be simplified for better readability. Overall, while the logic is present, the implementation could benefit from clearer naming and documentation.","tokens":491,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has a mix of Portuguese and English variable names, which may confuse readers. While the structure is clear, the use of non-descriptive names like \u0027coxa\u0027 and \u0027abobora\u0027 reduces readability. The logic is somewhat straightforward, but the lack of comments and context makes it harder to understand the purpose of the code. Overall, it is moderately readable but could benefit from clearer naming and documentation.","tokens":507,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name tomilho is not descriptive of its function, which affects readability. The use of pimentaCaiena suggests a specific context that is not clear without additional information. The calculation of the index is somewhat straightforward, but the overall intent of the method is ambiguous, making it harder to comprehend for someone unfamiliar with the code.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable and follows standard Java conventions. The use of clear variable names and a straightforward conditional structure aids comprehension. However, the return statement could be simplified to directly return the boolean expression, which would enhance clarity and reduce redundancy.","tokens":272,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with a well-defined purpose of calculating the area of a circle. The use of a constant for Pi enhances readability. However, the variable name \u0027P\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027PI\u0027, to improve clarity. Overall, the code is easy to understand and follows good practices.","tokens":269,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with meaningful variable names that indicate their purpose. The method performs a simple calculation and returns the result, making it easy to understand. However, a brief comment explaining the purpose of the method could enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with the context.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has a mix of Portuguese and English variable names, which can confuse readers. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 does not clearly indicate its purpose. While the use of statistical methods is appropriate, the lack of comments and context makes it harder to understand the overall functionality. The readability could be improved with clearer naming conventions and additional documentation.","tokens":324,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is relatively concise but uses non-descriptive variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027oregano\u0027, which can confuse readers. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 does not clearly indicate its purpose. The logic is straightforward, but the lack of comments and context makes it harder to understand at first glance. Overall, it is functional but could benefit from improved naming and documentation.","tokens":299,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
