{"score":"6","reasoning":"Logic correctly implements leap year check using standard rules. Code is simple and well-formatted, easy to follow. However, cryptic method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and param \u0027a\u0027 hinder immediate comprehension. Unnecessary \u0027else\u0027 with direct boolean return possible for better conciseness.","tokens":862,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Method name tomilho (thyme in Portuguese) and variable pimentaCaiena (cayenne pepper) are meaningless and obfuscated, hiding intent. Expression (ordinal()/3)*3 uses unexplained magic numbers, likely flooring to multiple of 3 but unclear why for Month enum. Syntactically valid but extremely hard to read or comprehend without external context.","tokens":858,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple, clean structure with proper use of final for constant and clear logic flow for circle area calculation. However, vague variable names (P for pi, a for area), hardcoded PI instead of Math.PI, and generic method name calc reduce self-documentation and readability.","tokens":838,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated, nonsensical names (paprica, alecrim, menta) that convey no intent, making it extremely hard to understand. Simple modulo logic is buried in cryptic expression; lacks comments or context. Violates all naming best practices, severely impacting readability and maintainability.","tokens":877,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses obfuscated Portuguese food-themed names like abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde making intent incomprehensible. Undeclared vars aspargos aipo MILHOS add confusion. Loop logic for tree population is structured but unreadable without context. Poor readability despite valid syntax.","tokens":1238,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is syntactically correct and concise, avoiding division by zero with ternary. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca are cryptic and non-descriptive, severely impacting readability and comprehension of purpose. Lacks comments or context, making it hard to grasp intent during due diligence.","tokens":926,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise, syntactically correct, and performs a simple triangle area calculation. Easy to comprehend the logic. Drawbacks: generic method name calc, unclear params b and a, unnecessary var r. Descriptive names would enhance readability.","tokens":934,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic Portuguese words like gengibre pimenta batata salsa as identifiers evoking vegetables spices rendering purpose intent utterly opaque. Syntactically clean but zero semantic clarity hinders comprehension maintenance. Major red flag for production code.","tokens":923,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of descriptive English ones. No comments or context. Obscure computation with redundant +12. Hard to comprehend intent despite simple modulo logic.","tokens":1192,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names (dv,p,s,d,i,n) and no comments make it hard to understand. Confusing loop indices process digits from end for Luhn check digit algo. Unnecessary String array and repeated parsing obscure logic. Requires tracing to comprehend, poor readability.","tokens":1695,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
