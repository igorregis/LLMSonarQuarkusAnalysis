{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple, correct circle area calculation with good final usage and clear structure. Easy to comprehend. Deductions for vague method name calc, unclear vars P and a, hardcoded imprecise PI instead of Math.PI, impacting maintainability.","tokens":802,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Logic for leap year check is correct and clearly structured with proper precedence. However, method name isAB and param a are unclear, hindering instant comprehension. Unnecessary else; could return boolean expression directly. Concise and easy to follow otherwise.","tokens":880,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs meaningless Portuguese herb names for methods and parameters (paprica, alecrim, menta), obscuring purpose entirely. Simple modulo and negation logic is present but intent is incomprehensible without context. Lacks comments or standard naming, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":894,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code has extremely poor readability: method and variable names are obfuscated Portuguese spice terms (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that reveal nothing about purpose. Cryptic logic with unnecessary +12 and modulo ops. No comments, assumes enum context. Very hard to comprehend.","tokens":970,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is syntactically clean and concise, using ternary for simple ratio calculation with div-by-zero guard. However, cryptic Portuguese words (brocolis\u003dbroccoli, espinafre\u003dspinach, jaca\u003djackfruit) as method names obscure intent and purpose, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":940,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese food names for methods variables and fields like gengibre pimenta batata salsa. No comments or documentation. References nonexistent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics adding confusion. Intent unclear violating all naming conventions.","tokens":1024,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Obfuscated names like tomilho and pimentaCaiena provide no semantic meaning, hindering comprehension. Magic number 3 in (ordinal()/3)*3 lacks explanation, obscuring grouping logic. Concise but intentionally cryptic, poor for maintenance or review.","tokens":942,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"0","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese food names for variables method and constants eg coxa abobora feijaoVerde inhame GRAO_DE_BICO making intent impossible to discern without reverse engineering. Undefined vars like aipo aspargos MILHOS aboboraMaca plus illogical ops feijaoVerde.nextFloat on int render it incomprehensible.","tokens":1201,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names (dv,p,s,d,n). Confusing backward loops and array indexing (oversized array with nulls). Excessive string manipulations and int parsing. No comments or clear purpose, requires step-by-step tracing to understand Luhn-like algorithm. Low readability.","tokens":1594,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is simple, correct, and easy to comprehend: calculates triangle area (b*a)/2. Logic flows clearly in one line. However, vague method name calc, non-descriptive params a/b, and redundant var r hurt readability. Better naming would improve it.","tokens":886,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
