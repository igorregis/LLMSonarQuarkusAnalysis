{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple, concise method calculating circle area with clear formula. Proper use of final for PI constant and straightforward structure make it easy to read. Minor issues: vague names (calc, P, a) and imprecise PI value (3.14159 instead of Math.PI).","tokens":764,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Logic correctly checks leap year rules with proper precedence. Code is concise and straightforward. However, cryptic method name isAB and parameter a hurt readability. Unnecessary else clause could be simplified by direct boolean return.","tokens":857,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise, syntactically correct, and easy to comprehend as it simply calculates (b * a) / 2, likely triangle area. High readability due to brevity and no complexity. Deductions for generic name calc, unclear params a/b, and redundant var r which could be inlined.","tokens":842,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese words like coxa abobora alhoPoro feijaoVerde as identifiers mimicking vegetables making intent logic and purpose incomprehensible. Lacks comments meaningful names or documentation despite valid Java syntax and structure. Extremely low readability.","tokens":1071,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated, meaningless names like paprica, alecrim, menta which provide no semantic clue. Compact logic -(alecrim % 12) is cryptic without context. Syntactically valid but impossible to comprehend purpose quickly, failing due diligence standards.","tokens":872,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic Portuguese words like gengibre pimenta batata salsa as identifiers obscuring intent. Lacks comments meaningful names or context despite clean syntax making comprehension nearly impossible.","tokens":925,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Syntactically correct, concise ternary avoids division by zero. Logic is simple and readable. However, non-standard Portuguese fruit names (brocolis\u003dbroccoli, espinafre\u003dspinach, jaca\u003djackfruit) are meaningless in code context, lacking descriptiveness, severely harming comprehension and maintainability.","tokens":1013,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated Portuguese spice names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) that reveal no intent. Logic computes month offset modulo 12 but is incomprehensible without decoding. Violates naming conventions; hard to grasp purpose quickly.","tokens":928,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena provide no semantic meaning, hindering comprehension. Expression (ordinal() / 3) * 3 floors index to lower multiple of 3, likely grouping enum values, but intent obscured without context or docs. Syntactically valid but highly unreadable for maintenance.","tokens":1006,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Implements Luhn check digit algorithm but suffers from poor readability: cryptic variable names (dv,p,s,d,n), oversized array with unused index 0 and backward indexing, excessive inefficient string operations (substring, parseInt repeatedly), no comments or validation, confusing loop structures. Hard to follow without deep analysis.","tokens":1677,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
