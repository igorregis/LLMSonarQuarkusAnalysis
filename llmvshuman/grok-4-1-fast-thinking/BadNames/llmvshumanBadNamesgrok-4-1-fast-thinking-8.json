{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated Portuguese vegetable names as variables (e.g., abobora, feijaoVerde, inhame), unclear method name coxa, and undefined external vars like aspargos, aipo, MILHOS. Logic is hidden behind meaningless identifiers, no comments, hard to comprehend purpose despite syntactically valid Java.","tokens":1009,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise, straightforward, and easy to understand as it calculates circle area with proper final constant and simple logic. Minor issues: vague method name calc, poor variable names P and a, hardcoded PI instead of Math.PI slightly hurt readability.","tokens":813,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"0","reasoning":"Code employs nonsensical Portuguese herb names for method paprica, parameter alecrim, and undefined menta, rendering it completely unreadable and incomprehensible. Lacks clarity on purpose, assumes external menta function, violates naming conventions, severely impacts maintainability.","tokens":773,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise, syntactically correct, and trivially computes triangle area ((b*a)/2). Easy to comprehend logic. Minor issues: vague method name calc, non-descriptive params b/a, unnecessary var r. High readability for simple snippet.","tokens":865,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Obfuscated method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena use meaningless Portuguese spice terms hiding intent. Magic number 3 in (ordinal()/3)*3 obscures grouping logic. No comments or clear purpose makes comprehension difficult despite simple structure.","tokens":896,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Correct leap year logic but poor naming: unclear method name isAB and param a hinder comprehension. Unnecessary if-else; could return boolean expression directly. Good formatting and structure otherwise.","tokens":891,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely low readability due to obfuscated Portuguese spice names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of descriptive English. Unclear purpose no comments. Convoluted math (ordinal() + (mod12 +12)%12) simplifies to add mod12 but obscures intent. Hard to comprehend without context.","tokens":1041,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated Portuguese variable names (batata, salsa, pimenta, etc.) that convey no meaning. Uses standard DoubleSummaryStatistics incorrectly with nonexistent fields. Simple operations but impossible to comprehend intent without context. Violates naming conventions.","tokens":1110,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is syntactically correct, concise, and handles division by zero safely with ternary operator. Logic is simple and easy to follow mechanically. However, cryptic Portuguese method names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) lack semantic meaning, hindering quick comprehension of purpose and maintainability.","tokens":1198,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code implements Luhn check digit but uses cryptic names (dv,p,s,d,n), oversized String array with confusing backward indexing (d[0] unused), multiple similar loops, repeated parsing, and no comments. Functional yet hard to read or comprehend quickly without tracing execution.","tokens":1633,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
