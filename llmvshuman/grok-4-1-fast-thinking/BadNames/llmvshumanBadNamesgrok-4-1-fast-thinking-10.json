{"score":"1","reasoning":"Method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena use unrelated Portuguese words, obscuring intent. Magic number 3 and ordinal manipulation lack context, making comprehension difficult. Syntactically correct but highly unreadable.","tokens":822,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple, clean code calculating circle area with clear structure and final constant usage. Easy to read and understand. Minor deductions for imprecise pi approximation (use Math.PI), vague names (P for pi, a for area), and lack of comments.","tokens":787,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs nonsensical names like paprica, alecrim, menta, obscuring purpose. Cryptic logic with negation of modulo 12 lacks clarity. Syntactically valid but extremely hard to read or comprehend without external context.","tokens":792,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Highly readable and easy to comprehend. Clear, concise logic for triangle area (base*height/2). Minor deductions for generic method name calc, non-descriptive params b and a, and redundant variable r.","tokens":855,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code correctly checks leap year logic but suffers from poor naming: method isAB and param a are unclear. Unnecessary else-return false; could simplify to return the condition directly. Structure and formatting are readable, aiding comprehension for those knowing the rules.","tokens":916,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic Portuguese spice-themed names for method menta, param nozMoscada, var oregano, and array pimentaCaiena, rendering purpose incomprehensible. Obscures simple month arithmetic via modulo ops. No comments or context; syntactically valid but unreadable for maintenance or review.","tokens":919,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese words as identifiers (e.g., coxa, abobora, feijaoVerde), rendering it nearly incomprehensible. Logic involves a loop generating tree nodes with fonts and colors, but meaningless names obscure intent, purpose, and flow. No comments exacerbate poor readability.","tokens":1049,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Syntactically correct and concise ternary avoids div-by-zero. But cryptic Portuguese names (brocolis\u003dbroccoli, espinafre\u003dspinach, jaca\u003djackfruit) fail to describe purpose, hindering comprehension. Calls getEspinafre twice unnecessarily. Standard English names needed for readability.","tokens":1175,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"0","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic Portuguese food names (gengibre, pimenta, batata, etc.) for methods, parameters, and variables, providing no semantic meaning. Accesses nonexistent fields like pimenta.batata on DoubleSummaryStatistics, rendering it invalid Java that wont compile. Zero readability or comprehension possible.","tokens":1296,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic single-letter variable names (p,s,d,n,i), no comments, backwards loops with confusing indices, inefficient string manipulations for digit processing, array sizing and null checks obscure intent. Recognizable as obfuscated Luhn/check digit algo but extremely hard to read and comprehend quickly.","tokens":1631,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
