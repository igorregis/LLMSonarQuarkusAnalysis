{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely low readability due to obfuscated Portuguese food/plant names as variables (e.g., coxa, abobora, feijaoVerde, inhame), unclear logic flow, undefined variables (aspargos, aipo, MILHOS), no comments. Hard to comprehend purpose despite valid syntax.","tokens":1015,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple, clean code calculating circle area with good use of final constant and straightforward logic. Easy to read and understand. Deductions for imprecise PI approximation (use Math.PI), generic names (P for PI, a for area). Overall highly comprehensible.","tokens":770,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated meaningless names like paprica alecrim menta hindering readability. Cryptic logic with modulo negation and undocumented menta call obscures intent and purpose making comprehension nearly impossible.","tokens":781,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code correctly implements leap year check with standard logic. Well-formatted and concise, easy to follow condition. However, cryptic method name isAB and param a obscure purpose, hindering quick comprehension. If-else redundant; could return boolean directly.","tokens":950,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is simple, correct, and easy to follow: computes (b*a)/2, likely triangle area. Proper Java syntax and structure. However, vague name calc, non-descriptive params b/a, and unnecessary var r hurt readability and self-documentation.","tokens":886,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese spice names as identifiers (nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena), rendering intent unclear. Assumes Month enum context with ordinal() and array access, but modulo logic is convoluted with redundant +12. No comments or descriptive naming hinders comprehension significantly.","tokens":916,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic Portuguese spice names (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) for method and variable obscure intent. Magic number 3 in ordinal-based index calculation (ordinal()/3*3) is unclear without context. Short but hard to comprehend, poor readability for maintenance.","tokens":1025,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese words as variable/method names (e.g., batata, pimenta, abobora) instead of descriptive English terms. No comments or context; intent is incomprehensible despite simple syntax. Fails basic naming conventions for maintainability.","tokens":1170,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is syntactically perfect, concise, and handles division by zero elegantly with ternary operator. However, non-standard Portuguese names for fruits/vegetables (brocolis\u003dbroccoli, espinafre\u003dspinach, jaca\u003djackfruit) are cryptic, non-descriptive, and violate Java naming conventions, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":1284,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names (dv,p,s,d,n,i) provide no hints. Backward loops with unusual indexing (array size p.length()+1, d[0] null) confuse flow. Excessive String ops, substrings, repeated Integer.valueOf parses inefficient and obscure. No comments or whitespace aids. Logic (Luhn-like check digit) requires tracing to understand, very low readability.","tokens":1778,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
