{"score":"6","reasoning":"Logic correctly checks leap year rules and is easy to follow. Good indentation. However, cryptic method name isAB and param a reduce clarity. Unnecessary else-return false; simplify to return the condition directly for better readability.","tokens":826,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Simple, concise code calculating circle area with clear structure and final constant. Easy to read and understand. Minor deductions for vague names (calc, a, P) and imprecise PI instead of Math.PI.","tokens":883,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple, concise code that clearly computes triangle area as (b*a)/2. Easy to comprehend logic. Deductions for vague method name calc, non-descriptive params b and a, and unnecessary intermediate var r.","tokens":856,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated, meaningless Portuguese spice names like nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena instead of descriptive identifiers. Cryptic logic with modulo operations and ordinal() lacks clarity or comments, hindering comprehension even for experts.","tokens":968,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Syntactically correct and concise ternary avoids division by zero elegantly. However, cryptic Portuguese fruit names (brocolis\u003dbroccoli, espinafre\u003dspinach, jaca\u003djackfruit) are meaningless in code context, making intent unclear and comprehension poor despite simple logic.","tokens":957,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code implements Luhn-like check digit but is highly obfuscated: meaningless vars (dv,p,s,d,n), confusing backward loops with off-by-one indices, oversized array with nulls, excessive String parsing/conversions instead of ints. No comments, poor spacing. Hard to comprehend without deep analysis.","tokens":1232,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated, meaningless names (paprica, alecrim, menta) which provide no hint of purpose. Uses magic number 12 and unexplained negation, making comprehension reliant on guessing context. Simple structure but intent is completely obscured.","tokens":878,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Obfuscated Portuguese herb names (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) make intent unclear. Magic number 3 in (ordinal()/3)*3 hides grouping logic (e.g., quarters/seasons). Syntactically simple but semantically opaque, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":986,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely low readability due to obfuscated Portuguese vegetable/plant names for all variables, methods, and constants, obscuring intent. Undeclared variables like aspargos, aipo, MILHOS; type mismatch on feijaoVerde.nextFloat() suggests non-compiling code. Logic is incomprehensible without deobfuscation.","tokens":1243,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese words (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata) as identifiers instead of descriptive names, rendering purpose incomprehensible. Accesses nonexistent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, lacks context/comments, violates Java conventions. Simple structure but zero semantic clarity.","tokens":1106,"name":"Combine.java"}
