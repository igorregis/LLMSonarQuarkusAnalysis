{"score":"8","reasoning":"Extremely simple and clear logic for triangle area calculation. Straightforward execution with no errors or complexity. Minor deductions for vague method name calc and non-descriptive params b a; could use direct return without r var for even better style.","tokens":892,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple, concise code computing circle area with clear structure and final constant. However, vague method name calc, non-descriptive vars a and P, imprecise PI value instead of Math.PI reduce readability. Easy to comprehend overall.","tokens":782,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"0","reasoning":"Code employs nonsensical names like paprica, alecrim, menta which convey no meaning, rendering it completely unreadable. Purpose is incomprehensible without external context; terse logic with modulo and negation lacks clarity or comments, failing all readability standards.","tokens":819,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code uses obfuscated Portuguese herb/spice names like tomilho and pimentaCaiena instead of descriptive identifiers, making intent unclear. Expression (ordinal()/3)*3 performs integer flooring to nearest multiple of 3 for array indexing, but lacks context or comments explaining quarter grouping or enum relation. Extremely low readability and comprehension.","tokens":852,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Logic for leap year check is correct and clearly structured with proper parentheses. However, cryptic method name isAB and parameter a hinder immediate comprehension. Unnecessary else-return false could be simplified to direct boolean return. Decent readability for experienced devs.","tokens":892,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is concise, syntactically correct, avoids division by zero with ternary, but meaningless Portuguese-inspired names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) hinder comprehension. No comments or context make it hard to grasp purpose quickly.","tokens":895,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic Portuguese spice-themed names (menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena) instead of descriptive English identifiers severely obscuring purpose. Modular arithmetic handles negative modulo for Month enum but lacks comments or context making comprehension extremely difficult for reviewers.","tokens":957,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely low readability due to obfuscated Portuguese variable and method names (e.g., gengibre, batata, pimenta) that convey no meaning. No comments or context provided. References non-existent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, causing confusion. Simple structure but impossible to comprehend intent without external knowledge.","tokens":1079,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"0","reasoning":"Code uses obfuscated Portuguese food-related variable names that reveal no purpose, contains compile errors like int feijaoVerde calling nextFloat(), undeclared variables (aspargos, aipo, MILHOS, aboboraMaca), poor structure, making it entirely unreadable and incomprehensible.","tokens":1322,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names (p,s,d,n) and no comments make intent unclear. Unusual array size (p.length()+1) with d[0] unused and backward indexing in loops confuses flow. Excessive string manipulations and multiple passes for digit processing hinder readability. Recognizable as Luhn-like algorithm but hard to comprehend without tracing.","tokens":1649,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
