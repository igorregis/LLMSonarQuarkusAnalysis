{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise, straightforward, and easy to comprehend: calculates triangle area as (b*a)/2. Logic is clear with no complexity. Minor deduction for vague parameter names (b,a instead of base,height) and generic method name (calc). Overall highly readable.","tokens":792,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Correct leap year logic but cryptic method name isAB and param a hurt readability. Unnecessary else-return true/false could be direct boolean return for simplicity. Formatting is clean but naming needs improvement for easy comprehension.","tokens":787,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to obfuscated, meaningless names like paprica, alecrim, menta which provide no semantic clue. Cryptic logic with modulo 12 and negation lacks context, making comprehension nearly impossible despite syntactic validity.","tokens":777,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple, concise code calculating circle area. Easy to comprehend with clear structure and final constant. Minor issues: vague name calc, unclear vars P and a, imprecise PI instead of Math.PI.","tokens":817,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs obfuscated Portuguese food/plant names for variables methods and constants severely hindering readability and comprehension. Structure is syntactically valid but intent is inscrutable without reverse engineering. Lacks comments or standard naming making it nearly impossible to follow quickly.","tokens":1071,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Obfuscated with unrelated Portuguese spice names (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) instead of descriptive English/Java conventions. Logic floors ordinal to nearest multiple of 3 for Month array access, but lacks comments/context, severely hindering comprehension despite brevity.","tokens":872,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code implements Luhn check digit but is highly obfuscated: cryptic names (dv,p,s,d,n), string-based digit ops with repeated parsing, confusing backward loops and array indexing (d[0] unused, off-by-one risks), no comments. Hard to comprehend without deep analysis.","tokens":1303,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Clean syntax with final modifier, single return, and proper zero-division avoidance via ternary. However, cryptic Portuguese names (Brocolis\u003dbroccoli, Espinafre\u003dspinach, Jaca\u003djackfruit) provide no semantic meaning, making comprehension difficult without context.","tokens":1027,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese spice names for method (menta), parameter (nozMoscada), variable (oregano), and field (pimentaCaiena). Obscures simple modular arithmetic for Month offset. No comments or descriptive identifiers, hard to comprehend purpose without deep analysis.","tokens":999,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely low readability due to obfuscated Portuguese variable and method names (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata) that provide no semantic meaning. Code assumes nonexistent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, preventing compilation. Simple structure but impossible to comprehend purpose without external context.","tokens":1157,"name":"Combine.java"}
