{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple straightforward circle area calc. Good use of final for PI approx. Clear structure easy to follow. Minor issues: approx PI not Math.PI vague vars P and a no comments. Highly readable overall.","tokens":754,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code employs cryptic, meaningless names like paprica, alecrim, menta which severely hinder readability and comprehension. Simple logic of modulo 12 negation and call to undefined menta lacks context, comments or documentation. Syntactically valid but intentionally obfuscated.","tokens":768,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code correctly checks leap year rules with clear logic and proper indentation. However, cryptic name isAB and param a reduce immediate comprehension. Redundant if-else-return could simplify to direct boolean return for better conciseness.","tokens":857,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Code has poor readability due to obfuscated Portuguese vegetable names as variables (e.g., coxa, abobora, feijaoVerde), making comprehension very difficult. Logic involves looping to create tree nodes with fonts and colors, but lacks comments and meaningful identifiers. Requires mental renaming to understand.","tokens":1070,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise, performs straightforward triangle area calculation without errors. Highly comprehensible due to single-line logic. Deduction for vague method name calc and parameters b,a lacking descriptiveness, impacting long-term readability.","tokens":907,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese spice-themed names like menta nozMoscada oregano pimentaCaiena which obscure intent. Unclear modular arithmetic logic with ordinal and array access lacks comments or descriptive identifiers making comprehension nearly impossible without deep context.","tokens":926,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is syntactically correct concise ternary avoiding div by zero but method names like getBrocolis getEspinafre getJaca are nonEnglish cryptic violating Java conventions hindering comprehension of purpose. Logic simple but semantic meaning unclear without context.","tokens":958,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Method name tomilho (thyme in Portuguese) and variable pimentaCaiena (cayenne pepper) are cryptic and non-descriptive violating Java naming conventions. Logic (ordinal()/3)*3 computes quarter-start month but is obfuscated without comments. Extremely low readability and comprehension.","tokens":977,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to cryptic variable names (dv,p,s,d,n), lack of comments, confusing backward loop indices, oversized array with unused slot, and inefficient string conversions/substrings for simple digit operations in a Luhn-like check digit algo. Hard to comprehend without step-by-step tracing.","tokens":1724,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic Portuguese food-related names for variables methods and fields batata salsa abobora etc which provide no semantic meaning hindering comprehension. Structure is simple but intent is opaque. Would not compile as DoubleSummaryStatistics lacks these fields. Lacks comments or clarity.","tokens":1238,"name":"Combine.java"}
