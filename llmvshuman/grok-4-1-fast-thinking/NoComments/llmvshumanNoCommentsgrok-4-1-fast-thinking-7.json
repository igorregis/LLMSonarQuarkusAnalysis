{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable code: clear Portuguese method and parameter names, simple direct formula for triangle area, proper static method signature, concise one-line computation with explicit variable for clarity, flawless formatting and no redundancy or errors.","tokens":816,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and concise getter method using ternary operator to safely compute average (sum/count) only if count \u003e0, else 0.0d. Clear logic, avoids division by zero, proper final modifier and double literal. Portuguese names consistent and intuitive. No issues, perfect comprehension.","tokens":773,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear, correct leap year logic with good formatting, indentation, and meaningful Portuguese names. Condition uses proper parentheses for clarity. Minor deduction for unnecessary if-else; could directly return the boolean expression for conciseness.","tokens":847,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, self-explanatory with clear Portuguese method and variable names. Uses final constant for PI, simple direct calculation without redundancy. Perfect readability and comprehension for its purpose.","tokens":796,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise, readable, and self-explanatory with clear variable names and straightforward operations for combining statistics. Minor deduction for sumWithCompensation calls requiring class context for full intuition, but overall highly comprehensible for Java developers.","tokens":838,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code has clear structure and logical flow for loading tree children with random names, fonts, and alternating colors. Portuguese names are consistent and intuitive. Minor deductions for legacy var declarations at top, magic number in modulo check, and external field dependencies. Highly readable for Java devs.","tokens":1040,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and correctly handles positive/negative months via modulo arithmetic with enums ordinal, but lacks comments, uses magic number 12, misleading var name amount, and complex expression (ordinal + (amount +12)%12) reduces immediate readability for non-experts.","tokens":1054,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Concise and efficient method using ordinal division to find first month of trimester. Descriptive Portuguese name aids comprehension. Formula is clever but requires brief mental math. Assumes sequential enum order and ENUMS array. Strong readability for Java devs.","tokens":1056,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is terse and functional but poor readability: magic number 12 unexplained, no comments or Javadoc, Portuguese method name subtrai and assumed soma method obscure intent for non-Portuguese readers. Unary negation and modulo lack context, hard to comprehend standalone purpose like month wrapping.","tokens":1343,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code calculates base10 check digit correctly but readability is poor: confusing backward loops with off-by-one indexing, unnecessary oversized String array with nulls, excessive String.valueOf and substring for digit splitting/summing, no comments. Could be simplified by processing digits in-place without array. Requires tracing to comprehend.","tokens":1621,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
