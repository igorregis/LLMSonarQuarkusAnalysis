{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear method name in Portuguese, correct leap year logic, good indentation and parentheses for readability. Minor nit: could simplify by directly returning the boolean expression instead of if-else.","tokens":819,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise,well-structured with clear sequential operations for combining statistics. Uses standard Math.min/max and direct field access. Easy to comprehend for Java devs familiar with summary stats. Slight deduction for no comments on sumWithCompensation logic.","tokens":854,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, well-structured with clear Portuguese method and parameter names. Uses final constant for PI appropriately, straightforward calculation and return. Self-explanatory, no redundancy, perfect readability and comprehension.","tokens":803,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Concise, readable getter method using ternary operator to safely compute average, avoiding division by zero. Clear Portuguese names (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma), final modifier, double literal with d suffix. Easy to comprehend instantly.","tokens":855,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is exceptionally readable: clear Portuguese method name describing isosceles triangle area calculation, intuitive parameter names (base, altura), correct simple formula with no redundancy, proper formatting and single responsibility. Easy to comprehend instantly for any Java developer.","tokens":780,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Well-structured loop with descriptive Portuguese names like novoNo, indiceAleatorio, stringExibicao. Clear logic: random name selection, font validation, alternating colors, node insertion. Deducts for old-style var declarations at top, magic number %2, heavy external deps like geradorNomes, NOMES. Generally readable and comprehensible.","tokens":1095,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise method using integer division on enum ordinal to return first month of trimester. Descriptive Portuguese name aids understanding. Assumes fixed enum order and ENUMS array, with magic number 3 slightly obscuring intent without comments, but overall comprehensible for Java enum experts.","tokens":941,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Concise implementation handles month wrapping including negatives via (amount+12)%12 trick, but cryptic magic numbers, undocumented ENUMS array, and ordinal reliance make it hard to comprehend quickly without context. Lacks comments for clarity.","tokens":988,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Invalid Java syntax: missing semicolon after return statement, causing compilation error. Extremely terse and cryptic logic with hardcoded 12 and reliance on undefined soma method. Intent to subtract months modulo 12 via negation is obscure without comments or context. Consistent Portuguese naming but overall poor readability and comprehension.","tokens":1502,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is convoluted: oversized string array with unused index 0 and null checks, backward loops with confusing indexing, repeated string parsing and manual splitting for carry-over instead of simple int math (prod/10 + prod%10). No comments, poor variable names. Functional but hard to read and comprehend quickly.","tokens":1783,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
