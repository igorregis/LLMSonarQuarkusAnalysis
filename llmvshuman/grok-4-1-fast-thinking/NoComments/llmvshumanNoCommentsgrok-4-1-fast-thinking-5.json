{"score":"10","reasoning":"Concise and clear getter method using ternary operator to safely compute average, avoiding division by zero. Method name getMedia is intuitive, final modifier good practice, double literal explicit. Easy to read and understand in one glance.","tokens":762,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is exceptionally readable and easy to comprehend. Descriptive Portuguese method name, intuitive parameter names (base, altura), straightforward single-line formula for triangle area, clean return. No redundancy, perfect structure for its purpose.","tokens":745,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise, method and variable names are clear and descriptive in Portuguese, uses final for PI constant appropriately, simple direct calculation. Minor deduction for hardcoded PI precision instead of Math.PI, but excellent readability overall.","tokens":811,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear method name and parameter in Portuguese. Correct leap year logic with proper parentheses. Straightforward if-else structure is easy to follow, though could simplify to direct boolean return. Excellent readability and comprehension for all levels.","tokens":882,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Concise and clever use of ordinal() to calculate the first month of the trimester assuming sequential enum order. Easy to understand for experienced devs, but magic number 3 and reliance on ENUMS array/ordering slightly reduce immediate clarity.","tokens":835,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Well-structured method with clear loop for creating child nodes. Consistent Portuguese variable names enhance readability for native speakers. Logic for random name selection, font checking, and alternating colors is straightforward and easy to follow. Minor deduction for non-English identifiers in broader contexts.","tokens":1046,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear, with descriptive variable names like count, simpleSum, min, max. Straightforward logic merges statistics using standard Math.min/max and internal sumWithCompensation calls. No redundancy, highly readable for any Java developer familiar with the class context.","tokens":1060,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise method correctly adds months to enum ordinal with wrap-around using modulo, handles negative months via (amount+12)%12. Relies on external ENUMS array and sequential ordinals. Formula is clever but not immediately intuitive without comments, slightly impacting readability.","tokens":1003,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Invalid Java syntax: missing semicolon after return statement. Poor formatting with cramped code and no spaces around operators. Portuguese names (subtrai, meses) hinder readability for non-Portuguese developers. Opaque logic using modulo 12 and undefined soma method lacks clarity and context.","tokens":1045,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code employs confusing backward loops and oversized array with unused index, excessive String manipulations and Integer parsing for simple digit doubling and summing, obscure indexing (i from length to 1), no comments, hard to trace logic despite probable correctness.","tokens":1562,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
