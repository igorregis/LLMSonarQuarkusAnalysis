{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and concise getter method using ternary operator to safely compute average (sum/count) only if count \u003e0, else 0.0. Clear intent, defensive programming, consistent Portuguese naming (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). No issues, perfect for comprehension.","tokens":731,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and straightforward. Clear method name in Portuguese, intuitive parameters (base, altura), correct formula implementation in one line, proper return. No redundancy or complexity; ideal for comprehension.","tokens":761,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear method name and parameter in Portuguese. Correct leap year logic with proper parentheses. Well-indented, straightforward if-else structure aids comprehension. Minor improvement: could omit explicit else for conciseness, but highly readable overall.","tokens":865,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise, readable, and easy to understand. Clear method and variable names in Portuguese. Proper use of final for PI constant. Simple logic with good structure. Minor deduction for hardcoded PI value instead of Math.PI for better precision and standard practice.","tokens":819,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear loop for loading child nodes using random names and alternating colors. Portuguese vars like contador and fonte aid locals but may confuse others. Font check logic is convoluted. Old Java var decl style. Assumes external fields. Linear flow aids comprehension.","tokens":1062,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise method with clear Portuguese name indicating intent: returns first month of trimester using ordinal math. Assumes ordered enum and ENUMS array (likely values()). Clever but relies on magic number 3 and enum order, slightly reducing immediate readability without full context.","tokens":830,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear, with straightforward field updates using intuitive operators and Math.min/max. sumWithCompensation calls are logically sequenced for accurate summation. Assumes class context but highly readable for Java devs familiar with summary stats. Minor deduction for lack of comments on compensation logic.","tokens":872,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is concise and functional for adding months to an enum with wrap-around, correctly handling negatives via (amount+12)%12 trick. However, lacks comments, uses magic number 12, undefined ENUMS, terse variable names, and ordinal() assumption reduce readability and ease of comprehension for non-experts.","tokens":991,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Concise method but logic is opaque: uses modulo 12 and negation via soma, assuming it handles wrap-around correctly. Intent to subtract months modulo 12 is not immediately clear without context or comments. Portuguese naming is consistent but lacks documentation, reducing overall readability.","tokens":1078,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code employs confusing array indexing (off-by-one with unused slot), excessive string parsing and substring ops instead of int math. Loops use awkward counters, hard to trace digit processing from right-to-left with alternating multipliers. No comments, poor variable reuse, low readability despite correct DV logic.","tokens":1990,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
