{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and concise getter method using ternary operator for safe average calculation. Clear Portuguese naming (getMedia, getSoma, getContagem) aligns with context. Single-line logic is intuitive, no redundancy, follows Java best practices perfectly.","tokens":758,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is exceptionally readable and easy to comprehend. Descriptive Portuguese method name and parameters clearly indicate purpose. Simple, correct formula with proper formatting. Intermediate variable aids clarity without complexity. No issues found.","tokens":762,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Highly readable code with clear Portuguese method name isAnoBissexto, correct leap year logic using standard divisibility rules, proper indentation and bracing. Simple if-else structure is easy to follow, though could be more concise with direct boolean return.","tokens":885,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Excepcionalmente legivel e compreensivel: metodo com nome claro em portugues, parametro bem nomeado, uso de final para PI, calculo direto e simples sem redundancias. Codigo conciso, sem comentarios desnecessarios pois e autoexplicativo.","tokens":836,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has clear loop and linear logic for loading child nodes with random names, fonts, and alternating colors. Portuguese vars like contador and fonte aid locals but may confuse others. Old var decl style and font check logic slightly reduce clarity. No major issues, comprehensible with context.","tokens":1058,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method name is clear and descriptive in Portuguese. Implementation is concise using ordinal math to compute first month of trimester assuming sequential enum and ENUMS array. Clever but slightly opaque without context on enum structure. Easy for Java enum experts, moderate otherwise.","tokens":858,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise and clear method for combining statistics. Uses intuitive field updates, standard Math.min/max, and straightforward compensated summation calls. Highly readable for Java experts; minor deduction for no inline comments on summation logic.","tokens":888,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is concise and functional for wrapping month addition with negative handling via (amount+12)%12 trick, but lacks clarity: magic number 12, poor variable name amount, assumes ENUMS is Month.values(), no comments or context. Dense and requires Java % knowledge for negatives, reducing readability.","tokens":1130,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and clever, using modulo 12 to handle month wrap-around by negating and delegating to soma method, which likely manages year adjustments. Portuguese names are consistent but may reduce accessibility. Lacks comments or explicit handling visibility, making it slightly opaque at first glance, though comprehensible to experienced devs.","tokens":1252,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code implements check digit calculation but uses confusing backward loops array indexing with off-by-one feel. Excessive String conversions parsing instead of integer math. Unnecessary oversized array unused slots. Logic hard to follow without step-by-step tracing no comments. Functional but low readability comprehension.","tokens":1577,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
