{"score":"10","reasoning":"Concise, clear ternary operator handles average calculation safely avoiding division by zero. Method name and calls are intuitive in Portuguese context. Uses final keyword and proper double literal. Excellent readability and comprehension.","tokens":694,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, correctly calculates triangle area with clear Portuguese naming (calcularAreaTrianguloIsosceles, base, altura). Simple formula, no redundancy, easy to comprehend for any Java developer familiar with basic math.","tokens":751,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, self-explanatory with clear Portuguese naming (calcularAreaCirculo, raio), uses final constant for PI, simple direct calculation without redundancy. Perfect readability and comprehension for its purpose.","tokens":788,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear, concise implementation of leap year logic with correct Gregorian rule. Descriptive Portuguese naming (isAnoBissexto, ano). Proper indentation and parentheses. Slightly verbose if-else; direct boolean return would be more idiomatic.","tokens":873,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise and clever use of ordinal and integer math to return first month of trimester assuming sequential enum order and ENUMS as values array. Method name is clear in Portuguese. Slightly opaque without mental calculation or context on ENUMS and enum stability risks minor deduction for readability.","tokens":894,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise method with clear variable names and standard operations like Math.min/max. Straightforward additions for count and simpleSum. sumWithCompensation calls are logical for Kahan summation but slightly less intuitive without class context. Overall highly readable and easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":933,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Concise but cryptic: magic number 12 repeated without explanation, complex modulo with (amount+12)%12 to handle negatives not obvious. Uses fragile ordinal(), poor variable names, no comments. Intent (add months wrapping around year) requires analysis, low readability.","tokens":991,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is syntactically correct and concise, but readability is low due to obfuscated logic: modulo 12 is magic and unexplained, negative soma call hides subtraction intent. Lacks braces, spaces, and comments. Portuguese names are clear for natives, but overall hard to comprehend without context.","tokens":1088,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is straightforward, creating random child tree nodes with alternating colors and font checks. Portuguese variable names are clear for native speakers. Logic is linear but font condition is slightly tricky. Outdated var declarations outside loop reduce modernity. No comments or constants for colors/magic numbers. Overall comprehensible but improvable.","tokens":1326,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code employs confusing reverse loops with off-by-one indexing and oversized String array. Excessive String.valueOf Integer.valueOf and substring calls instead of simple math. Unclear why numeros0 is nullunused. Logic obscured by index tricks hard to follow without tracing. No comments add to poor readability.","tokens":1469,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
