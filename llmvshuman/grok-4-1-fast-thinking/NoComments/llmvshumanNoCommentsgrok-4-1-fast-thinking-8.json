{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, with clear Portuguese method name and parameters matching the formula. Single-line computation is straightforward and correct for triangle area. No redundancy, perfect readability and comprehension.","tokens":719,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and concise. Ternary operator clearly handles division by zero case elegantly. Portuguese names like getMedia, getSoma, getContagem are consistent and intuitive. Single return statement with no side effects. Ideal for comprehension.","tokens":743,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clean, concise implementation of Gregorian leap year rule. Descriptive Portuguese method name. Standard modulo conditions are clear and correct. Unnecessary else clause slightly reduces elegance but does not hinder comprehension. Excellent readability overall.","tokens":799,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, well-structured with clear Portuguese naming (calcularAreaCirculo, raio). Uses final constant for PI, simple direct calculation, proper return. No redundancy, excellent indentation. Instantly comprehensible for any Java developer.","tokens":762,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise method with clear intent for combining statistics. Uses descriptive fields and standard Math.min/max. Straightforward additions and compensation calls are easy to follow for Java devs familiar with summary stats. Lacks comments on Kahan summation but highly readable overall.","tokens":850,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Concise method with descriptive Portuguese name indicating it returns the first month of the trimester. Uses clever ordinal math (ordinal()/3*3) assuming sequential enum order, which is efficient but slightly cryptic without context. Magic number 3 could be named for clarity, but overall readable for experienced devs.","tokens":905,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses descriptive Portuguese names like novoNo,indiceAleatorio,dados making intent clear. Loop logic for random names,font check,color alternation (red/blue),node creation and insert is straightforward. Minor issues: outdated var declarations at top,no comments,dense font if-else,assumes fields like geradorNomes,NOMES. Readable but improvable.","tokens":1108,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise, syntactically correct, and uses clear Portuguese naming (subtrai for subtract, meses for months). Logic delegates to soma with negated modulo 12, which is clever for month wrapping but non-obvious without context or comments, slightly hindering full comprehension.","tokens":1137,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise code correctly adds months modulo 12, handling negatives with (amount+12)%12 trick. Uses ordinal() and ENUMS array effectively for enum cycling. Magic number 12 lacks context, complex nested expression slightly obscures intent, but clear to experienced devs.","tokens":1160,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code calculates base-10 check digit but readability is poor: confusing array sizing and backward indexing leaving index 0 null, excessive string conversions parsing and substring ops for simple digit math, multiple backward loops obscure flow, no comments or clear variable names. Functional but hard to follow and refactor.","tokens":1522,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
