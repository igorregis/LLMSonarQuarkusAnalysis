{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is exceptionally readable and easy to comprehend. Descriptive Portuguese method name and parameters clearly indicate purpose. Simple, direct formula implementation with no redundancy or complexity. Follows Java conventions perfectly.","tokens":731,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise method with clear variable names and straightforward operations. sumWithCompensation calls are slightly advanced but well-structured. Highly readable for Java developers familiar with summary statistics.","tokens":762,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and concise. Ternary operator perfectly handles average calculation with zero-check. Clear Portuguese naming consistent with context, straightforward logic, no redundancy. Ideal for comprehension.","tokens":729,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, self-explanatory with clear Portuguese names like calcularAreaCirculo and raio. Uses final for PI constant, simple direct calculation without redundancy. Perfect readability and comprehension for a utility method.","tokens":774,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear Portuguese method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 and parameter \u0027ano\u0027. Correct leap year logic with proper grouping. Simple if-else structure is easy to follow, though direct boolean return would be more idiomatic. Well-formatted and concise, excellent readability.","tokens":882,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Well-structured method with clear loop logic for creating child nodes. Portuguese variable names are consistent and intuitive. Straightforward random selection, font check, and color alternation. Minor deductions for magic numbers (e.g., %2 for colors) and legacy-style variable declarations at top. Highly readable and comprehensible.","tokens":1060,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise and efficient use of ordinal math to compute first month of trimester assuming sequential enum order and ENUMS array. Method name clearly indicates purpose in Portuguese. However magic number 3 and lack of comments or constants make it slightly cryptic for newcomers reducing immediate comprehension.","tokens":891,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and functional for adding months modulo 12 in an enum, correctly handling negatives with (amount + 12) % 12. However, lacks comments explaining the idiom, uses magic numbers, undefined ENUMS (assumed values()), and cryptic expression reduces immediate readability for non-experts.","tokens":976,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is extremely concise but cryptic: uses modulo 12 and negation without explanation or comments, relying on soma method to handle subtraction via addition. Intent (wrap-around month subtraction) requires mental computation to grasp. Lacks spacing, docs; long param unusual for months. Readable only with class context.","tokens":1076,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code employs confusing backward loops, oversized String array with off-by-one indexing, excessive string conversions, and manual digit splitting for sums. Lacks comments, clear variable names, and direct integer processing, obscuring the check digit logic and reducing readability significantly.","tokens":1667,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
