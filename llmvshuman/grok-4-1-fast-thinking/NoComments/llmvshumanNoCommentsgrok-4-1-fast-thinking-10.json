{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely concise and clear method using ternary operator to safely compute average (sum/count) only if count \u003e 0, else 0.0. Portuguese names are consistent and intuitive. No redundancy, perfect readability and comprehension.","tokens":747,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise method with clear intent: combines statistics from another instance. Uses straightforward assignments, standard Math.min/max, and class-specific sumWithCompensation. Assumes familiarity with class internals but logic flows intuitively without redundancy or complexity.","tokens":802,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, self-explanatory with clear Portuguese names like calcularAreaCirculo and raio. Uses final for PI constant, simple formula, proper structure. Perfect readability and comprehension for its purpose.","tokens":817,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and easy to comprehend. Simple, correct implementation of triangle area formula with descriptive Portuguese names for method, parameters, and variable. Proper static method structure, concise body, no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":803,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear method name in Portuguese, correct leap year logic with proper precedence. Well-indented, easy to follow if-else structure. Highly readable for beginners. Slight deduction for not directly returning the boolean expression, which would be more concise in Java.","tokens":918,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear loop and linear logic for generating child nodes. Portuguese names are consistent. Issues: vars declared at top old-style, magic %2 for colors, convoluted font check, assumes undeclared fields like geradorNomes. Comprehensible but improvable.","tokens":1061,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Concise method but low readability due to magic number 12 repeated without explanation, nested modulo operations with casts that obscure negative month handling, reliance on undefined ENUMS array, and lack of comments. Intent is month wrapping but requires mental parsing.","tokens":914,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Concise method that correctly computes the first month of a trimester using integer division on enum ordinal. Clear Portuguese name matches purpose. Deducts points for magic number 3 and reliance on undefined ENUMS array, reducing standalone readability without context.","tokens":922,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Portuguese method name subtrai and var meses aid locals but confuse others. Concise but cryptic logic: soma(-(meses%12)) hides intent of subtracting month remainder, assuming soma wraps. Magic 12 unexplained. Hard to grasp without class context.","tokens":1172,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code implements check digit calculation but uses confusing backward loop indices from length to 1, unnecessary oversized String array, and excessive String parsing with Integer.valueOf and substring instead of simple modulo arithmetic. Variable names are ok but lack comments. Logic requires index tracing, reducing readability and comprehension.","tokens":1818,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
