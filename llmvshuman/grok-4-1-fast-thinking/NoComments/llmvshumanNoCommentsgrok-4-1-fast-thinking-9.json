{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and comprehensible. Concise ternary operator perfectly handles average calculation with zero-check. Final modifier enhances immutability. Portuguese names (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma) are consistent and clear. No redundancy or complexity.","tokens":719,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is concise, self-explanatory with descriptive Portuguese names (calcularAreaCirculo, raio), uses final constant for PI, simple direct calculation without redundancy. Perfect readability and comprehension for its purpose.","tokens":769,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise, uses clear variable names and standard Math methods. Logical flow for combining statistics: adds counts/sums, compensates sums, updates min/max. Self-explanatory for Java devs familiar with summary stats, minor deduction for lacking comments.","tokens":809,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clean, correct leap year logic with clear Portuguese naming. Well-indented and easy to follow. Minor deduction for unnecessary if-else; could directly return the boolean expression for better conciseness.","tokens":832,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is clear in intent: loops to create child tree nodes with random names, conditional fonts, alternating red/blue colors. Meaningful Portuguese var names, simple structure. Minor issues: top-level declarations outdated, font logic slightly confusing, relies on external fields. Readable with context.","tokens":1045,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable and easy to comprehend. Simple, correct implementation of triangle area formula using base and height. Descriptive Portuguese method and parameter names suit the context. Single computation line with explicit return. No redundancy, errors, or complexity. Ideal for quick understanding.","tokens":813,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Concise and clever use of integer division on enum ordinal to return first month of trimester assuming sequential ordering. Method name clearly indicates purpose in Portuguese. Highly readable for experienced Java devs familiar with enums, though lacks inline comment for broader accessibility.","tokens":897,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Concise method for month arithmetic with wrapping, correctly handles negative months via (amount+12)%12. However, nested modulos, magic numbers, ordinal() usage, and unmentioned ENUMS reduce readability and require mental parsing for full comprehension.","tokens":960,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code calculates base10 check digit but has low readability: confusing reverse indexing in loops, oversized String array with unused null slot, repeated int parsing from Strings instead of direct math, no comments, hard to follow without tracing indices and logic.","tokens":1579,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code is extremely terse and cryptic. Subtracting via soma with negative modulo 12 is clever for month-of-year wrapping but not intuitive without context or comments. No spaces after return, Portuguese names ok for evaluator, but overall hard to comprehend quickly. Lacks clarity on intent and assumptions about soma method.","tokens":1407,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
