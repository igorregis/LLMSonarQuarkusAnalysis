{"score":"5","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces international readability. Logic uses negation and modulo which may not be immediately clear. Relies on external method soma without context. Code is concise but lacks self-documentation.","tokens":2129,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively to handle division by zero. Method names are clear in context, and the logic is straightforward for Java developers.","tokens":1259,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses confusing array indices and unnecessary string conversions, making it hard to follow. Variable names in Portuguese may reduce readability for non-speakers. The algorithm logic is obscured by poor implementation choices.","tokens":2875,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code has a clear loop structure and uses constants well, but Portuguese variable names and lack of comments may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1768,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise with a clear method name in Portuguese. However, the logic using integer division may not be immediately intuitive, and reliance on ordinal() could be error-prone if the enum order changes.","tokens":1468,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method clearly implements standard leap year check. Slightly verbose; direct return of boolean expression would enhance conciseness. Name is descriptive in Portuguese context.","tokens":1692,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with descriptive Portuguese names and simple logic. However, using Math.PI instead of a hardcoded value would enhance accuracy and standard practice.","tokens":1300,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is extremely readable with clear descriptive names in Portuguese and straightforward logic for area calculation Easy to comprehend at a glance","tokens":1431,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method and variable names are mostly clear, but sumWithCompensation is cryptic without context, slightly hindering comprehension.","tokens":1487,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but uses complex modulus arithmetic without comments, making it less intuitive. Variable names are adequate but could be clearer for better comprehension.","tokens":2039,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
