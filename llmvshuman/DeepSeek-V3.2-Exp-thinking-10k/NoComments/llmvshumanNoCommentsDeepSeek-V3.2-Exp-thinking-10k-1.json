{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses modulo for month arithmetic, but Portuguese method names may reduce readability for non-speakers. Logic is clear and easy to understand with context.","tokens":1559,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise code using ternary operator for conditional return, clearly handles division by zero, and method names indicate intent. Easy to comprehend.","tokens":1330,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code calculates a check digit but has poor readability due to complex indexing, unnecessary string conversions, and lack of comments. Variable names in Portuguese are descriptive but not standard in Java, reducing global comprehension.","tokens":2732,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is well-structured with descriptive Portuguese variable names, but lacks comments and uses non-English terms, which may reduce readability for some developers.","tokens":2015,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise but relies on ordinal() which is fragile. Method name is clear in Portuguese, but ENUMS is undefined in snippet, reducing clarity.","tokens":1728,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code correctly implements leap year logic and is straightforward. However, the Portuguese method name may hinder international readability, and the if-else structure could be simplified for better conciseness.","tokens":1918,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and concise with good naming in Portuguese. Hardcoded PI instead of Math.PI is a minor flaw but does not significantly hinder readability.","tokens":1338,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with descriptive method and variable names in Portuguese, clear logic for calculating triangle area, and simple structure with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1400,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is generally readable with clear variable names and simple operations, but the use of sumWithCompensation without context may reduce comprehension for those unfamiliar with floating-point compensation techniques.","tokens":1427,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code correctly handles month addition with wrap-around for positive and negative values, but the logic is somewhat cryptic due to the +12 adjustment and lack of comments. Variable names could be more descriptive.","tokens":2051,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
