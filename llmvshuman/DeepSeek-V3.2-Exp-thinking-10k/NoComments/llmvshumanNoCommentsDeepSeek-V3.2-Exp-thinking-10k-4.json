{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses Portuguese method names which may hinder global readability. Logic reuses add method for subtraction which is not intuitive. Minimal formatting affects clarity.","tokens":1195,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively to calculate the average while avoiding division by zero. Method names in Portuguese are descriptive and clear for native speakers, making the intent easy to understand.","tokens":1199,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses string arrays for numerical operations, backwards loops, and non-English variable names, reducing readability and making it hard to follow.","tokens":3299,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear logic, but Portuguese variable names may reduce readability for non-native speakers. No comments are present, though the flow is easy to follow.","tokens":1391,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses efficient integer division logic. However, the undefined ENUMS variable and Portuguese method name may confuse some readers. It could benefit from comments or clearer naming for better comprehension.","tokens":1384,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and correct for leap year check, but the if-else is redundant; directly returning the boolean expression would improve readability. Method name is descriptive in Portuguese.","tokens":1761,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with descriptive names and simple logic. Using Math.PI instead of a hard-coded value would improve accuracy and adhere to standard practices.","tokens":1418,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with clear descriptive names and simple logic making it easy to understand quickly","tokens":1487,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise with clear variable names and standard methods, but the sumWithCompensation calls require prior knowledge of floating-point compensation, slightly hindering immediate comprehension.","tokens":1289,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is short but relies on enum ordinal which is fragile. The modulo arithmetic with +12 ensures correct indexing but is not intuitive. Lack of comments and poor variable names reduce clarity.","tokens":2762,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
