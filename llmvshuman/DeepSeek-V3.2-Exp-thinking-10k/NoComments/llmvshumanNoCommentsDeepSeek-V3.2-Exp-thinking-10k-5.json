{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method names in Portuguese may hinder understanding. Compact logic with modulo operation could be confusing, especially for negative values.","tokens":2483,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively for average calculation, handling zero count safely. Portuguese method names are clear in context but may limit international readability. Overall, it is highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1373,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code has confusing array indexing with unused index 0 and uses inefficient string operations. Variable names in Portuguese may hinder international readability. Algorithm is correct but not straightforward due to backward loops and unnecessary conversions.","tokens":3313,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Clear structure and descriptive Portuguese variable names aid comprehension for speakers, but lack of comments and language specificity may hinder broader accessibility.","tokens":2036,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name is in Portuguese, which may not be universally understood. The index calculation uses integer division correctly but is not immediately intuitive. The ENUMS array is undefined in the snippet, adding ambiguity.","tokens":1497,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear with a descriptive method name and correct logic, but the if-else structure is redundant and can be simplified to return the boolean expression directly for better readability.","tokens":1557,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear descriptive names in Portuguese and a simple calculation. Using a constant for PI improves maintainability. Minor issue with hard-coded PI value instead of Math.PI.","tokens":1384,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with clear method and variable names in Portuguese. The logic is simple and correct for calculating the area of an isosceles triangle, making it easy to understand and maintain.","tokens":1316,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code uses clear variable names and standard methods, making it mostly readable. However, the sumWithCompensation calls may require domain knowledge for full comprehension, slightly reducing ease of understanding.","tokens":1866,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code correctly handles month addition with wrap-around, but the index calculation is complex and non-intuitive, reducing readability. Variable names could be more descriptive.","tokens":2125,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
