{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name in Portuguese reduces international readability. Modulus usage may not handle negative inputs correctly. Code is concise but lacks clarity on edge cases and relies on undefined method soma.","tokens":2762,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses a clear ternary operator for average calculation. Portuguese method names are descriptive but may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1594,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese variable names and inefficient string conversions, reducing clarity. Array indexing is confusing with off-by-one risks, and the algorithm lacks comments, making it hard to follow. However, the logical separation into distinct loops provides some structure.","tokens":4431,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses descriptive Portuguese variable names and has clear structure, but lacks comments and the font display logic may confuse without context, slightly reducing comprehension.","tokens":1622,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method uses integer division to group months into quarters, which is efficient but not self-explanatory. The Portuguese method name and non-standard ENUMS array may reduce readability for international teams or those unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":1480,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is clear and functional for leap year check, but uses verbose if-else instead of direct return. Portuguese method name is appropriate for context, slightly reducing international readability.","tokens":1552,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and clear with descriptive Portuguese names, but hardcoded PI instead of Math.PI slightly reduces readability and accuracy.","tokens":1565,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear method name in Portuguese, straightforward calculation for triangle area. Highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1754,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method name and most operations are clear and standard, but sumWithCompensation calls may require context for full comprehension, slightly reducing ease of understanding.","tokens":1586,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses a complex modulo expression with added 12 that may not be immediately clear. Variable name amount is vague. No comments provided, making it harder to understand the intent.","tokens":1552,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
