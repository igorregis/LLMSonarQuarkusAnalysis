{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise but uses Portuguese names and modulus with negation, which may confuse readers and reduce clarity in international contexts.","tokens":2227,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and clear, using a ternary operator for safe average calculation with division by zero handling. Descriptive method names in Portuguese aid comprehension for native speakers, though the ternary might be less intuitive for some developers.","tokens":1329,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses inefficient string operations and confusing index handling, reducing readability. Variable names like \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive, and the logic is convoluted for a simple check digit calculation.","tokens":2266,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Portuguese variable names may reduce readability for non-native speakers. Code logic is straightforward but lacks comments for clarity. Good use of constants and structure, though font check could be clearer.","tokens":1631,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Compact code but non-standard ENUMS array and integer division may confuse. Portuguese method name reduces international readability.","tokens":1472,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name is descriptive and the logic is standard for leap year check. However, using direct return instead of if-else would enhance readability and conciseness.","tokens":1636,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear with descriptive Portuguese names, uses constants, and has simple logic. Minor issue with hard-coded PI instead of Math.PI.","tokens":1235,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with descriptive method and variable names, straightforward logic using standard area formula, and no complexity, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1484,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code has clear variable names and a simple structure, making basic operations easy to follow. However, the sumWithCompensation calls are not explained, which may confuse those unaware of floating-point error handling techniques.","tokens":1750,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code uses magic number 12 and a non-obvious modulo calculation to handle month wrapping, which reduces clarity and ease of comprehension.","tokens":2087,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
