{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and simple logic. Minor issue: hard-coded PI instead of using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":1474,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Method and variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, logic is straightforward and correct, ensuring high readability for Portuguese-speaking developers.","tokens":1808,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear with descriptive names and standard operations. The sumWithCompensation method may require knowledge of floating-point compensation, but it is readable for experienced Java developers.","tokens":1532,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses vague variable names and unclear logic with the +12 addition, making it hard to understand the intention. The use of ordinal() is fragile and not best practice. However, it is concise but lacks clarity.","tokens":1920,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
