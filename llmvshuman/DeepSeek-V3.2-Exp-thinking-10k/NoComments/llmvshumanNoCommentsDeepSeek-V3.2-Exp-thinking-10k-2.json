{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code has compilation error due to missing semicolon. Portuguese method names are not standard and reduce readability. Logic uses addition for subtraction, which may confuse.","tokens":1793,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a standard ternary operator for conditional logic, making it easy to read. Method names in Portuguese are clear in context, and it properly handles division by zero.","tokens":1389,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to non-standard variable names in Portuguese, complex loop indices, and no comments. Multiple string conversions and potential logic errors hinder comprehension and maintenance.","tokens":4400,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code uses descriptive Portuguese variable names and has clear structure, but lacks comments and has complex logic like font display checks that may hinder comprehension without context.","tokens":1829,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name is clear in Portuguese, but code relies on ordinal() and integer division, which may not be obvious. Concise but could be more readable.","tokens":1724,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and follows standard leap year logic, making it easy to comprehend. However, it could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression instead of using if-else.","tokens":1262,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear method and variable names in Portuguese. It uses a constant for PI, avoiding magic numbers, and the logic is straightforward for calculating the area of a circle.","tokens":1429,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, descriptive for native speakers. Code is concise, uses standard formula, and is easy to understand with no complexity.","tokens":2121,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code has clear variable names and uses standard Java methods, but the sumWithCompensation calls are cryptic without context, reducing readability for those unfamiliar with numerical compensation techniques.","tokens":1415,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is functional but lacks clarity in variable naming and uses a non-intuitive modulo calculation. Improvement possible with better names and comments.","tokens":1497,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
