{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese method names, reducing clarity for non-speakers. Logic is concise but relies on mathematical trickery that may not be obvious without context. However, it is correct and efficient for month arithmetic.","tokens":1392,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively for average calculation, avoiding division by zero. Logic is clear, though method names are in Portuguese, which may affect non-native speakers but remains comprehensible.","tokens":1311,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses confusing array indices and unnecessary string manipulations, making it hard to follow. Variable names are in Portuguese, reducing readability. Logic is not immediately clear, requiring deep analysis to understand.","tokens":2221,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has descriptive Portuguese variable names and clear loop structure. Font check condition is complex without comments, but color alternation is easy to follow. Overall readable but could be improved.","tokens":1738,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name is clear in Portuguese and the code is concise, but it uses a magic number 3 and relies on enum ordinal, which may not be intuitive. The undefined ENUMS variable reduces clarity without context.","tokens":1590,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear and uses standard leap year logic. Minor improvement possible by directly returning the condition instead of if-else.","tokens":1569,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with descriptive names in Portuguese and simple logic. However, using a hard-coded PI value instead of Math.PI reduces adherence to Java standards.","tokens":1547,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and straightforward with descriptive names and simple logic, but the method name implies it is for isosceles triangles specifically while the formula is general, which may cause minor confusion.","tokens":1416,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method uses clear variable names and standard Java operations, making the combination logic easy to understand. However, the sumWithCompensation calls may require additional context for full comprehension.","tokens":1229,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses vague variable names like amount and unclear modulo arithmetic. Adding comments or using Math.floorMod could improve clarity and ease of understanding.","tokens":2788,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
