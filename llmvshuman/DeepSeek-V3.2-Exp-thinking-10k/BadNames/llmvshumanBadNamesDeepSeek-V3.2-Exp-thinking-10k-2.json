{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, making intent unclear. Modulo and negation logic is simple but lacks context, reducing readability. Overall, comprehension is difficult due to poor naming and undefined dependencies.","tokens":1599,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple and clear logic with ternary operator. Portuguese method names are descriptive in context but may not be universally understandable.","tokens":1898,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable names and lack of comments hinder understanding. Complex string manipulations and unclear array indexing reduce readability. Code is dense and not self-explanatory.","tokens":2330,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are all food-related and not descriptive, making the code very hard to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming conventions and lack of comments.","tokens":1510,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese and not descriptive. The index calculation (ordinal()/3)*3 is cryptic without context. Code is concise but lacks clarity for general readability.","tokens":1650,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name and variable name are not descriptive, making purpose unclear. Logic is standard for leap year check but could be simplified with direct return. Readable but improvable.","tokens":1302,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and the logic is clear for area calculation, but method name calc is vague, variable names are not descriptive, and hard-coded pi instead of Math.PI hinders readability.","tokens":1450,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and the logic is clear, but the method name \u0027calc\u0027 and parameter names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive, reducing immediate comprehension. However, the calculation is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":1624,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese food names for methods and variables, violating Java naming conventions and making it hard to understand the purpose without context, significantly reducing readability.","tokens":1945,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable and method naming in non-English terms reduces readability. The modulo logic is confusing without comments or context.","tokens":1607,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
