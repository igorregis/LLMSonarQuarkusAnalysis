{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor naming with cryptic names like paprica, alecrim, and menta. Logic involves modulo and negation but is unclear without context, reducing readability.","tokens":1280,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses clear ternary logic to prevent division by zero, but method names in Portuguese reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers, potentially hindering comprehension.","tokens":1583,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable naming and lack of comments make the code hard to understand. Complex logic with multiple loops and string manipulations reduces readability. Array indexing may cause confusion.","tokens":2568,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are in Portuguese and not descriptive, causing confusion. Code has compilation error with invalid method call on int, reducing comprehensibility.","tokens":1812,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method and variable names are obscure and non-descriptive, reducing readability. The calculation is straightforward but lacks clarity without comments.","tokens":1653,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Poor method and parameter naming obscure the code\u0027s purpose. The if-else block is unnecessary and could be simplified to a direct return for better clarity.","tokens":1473,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and easy to understand, but non-descriptive names like calc, P, and a slightly reduce readability. The logic is clear and the use of a constant for pi is good.","tokens":1308,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Simple calculation makes it easy to comprehend, but non-descriptive method and parameter names hinder readability.","tokens":1339,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses obscure Portuguese names for variables and methods, making it very hard to understand. The logic is unclear and may misuse standard Java classes, severely reducing readability.","tokens":1522,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Non-descriptive Portuguese names hinder comprehension. Modulo logic is clear but purpose obscured by poor naming conventions.","tokens":1570,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
