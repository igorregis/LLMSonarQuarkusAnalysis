{"score":"3","reasoning":"Non-descriptive method and variable names reduce readability. The modulo and negation logic is unclear without context, hindering comprehension.","tokens":2580,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and handles division by zero well, but Portuguese method names may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1740,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names and lacks comments, making the algorithm hard to follow. Multiple loops and array manipulations add complexity without clear purpose, reducing readability.","tokens":1492,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic variable names in Portuguese, hindering understanding. Contains a likely compilation error with invalid method call on int. No comments to clarify purpose.","tokens":2327,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Non-English names and complex index calculation hinder understanding.","tokens":1629,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code uses standard leap year logic but has poor naming like isAB and a, which hinders comprehension. Structure is clear.","tokens":1267,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method name calc is vague and not descriptive, reducing initial comprehension. The code uses a hard-coded pi value instead of Math.PI, which is less accurate and standard. However, the logic is simple and easy to follow.","tokens":1912,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and the calculation is straightforward, making it easy to grasp. However, the use of non-descriptive variable names like b, a, and r hampers readability and could confuse readers about the purpose without context.","tokens":1286,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic Portuguese names for methods and variables, obscuring intent. Standard Java operations are present, but poor naming makes comprehension difficult.","tokens":1835,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive and metaphorical variable names in Portuguese, making it hard to understand the purpose without context. The logic involves modulo arithmetic which is straightforward but obscured by poor naming.","tokens":1638,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
