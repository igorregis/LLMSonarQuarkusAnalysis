{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor naming with non-descriptive words like paprica and alecrim hinders understanding. Simple modulo and negation logic is obscured by cryptic identifiers, making comprehension difficult without context.","tokens":1213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear Portuguese method names. Ternary operator efficiently handles conditional logic, preventing division by zero, making it easy to understand.","tokens":1463,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names and messy indexing make code hard to follow. String manipulations instead of integer math reduce clarity. Lack of comments exacerbates confusion.","tokens":2813,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non descriptive Portuguese variable names and contains a compilation error with feijaoVerde nextFloat reducing readability and comprehension","tokens":2217,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Poor naming makes the code\u0027s intent unclear. The method and array names are unrelated to their functionality, which is to return a month based on quarter grouping.","tokens":1567,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Method name isAB and parameter a are unclear, but the leap year logic is standard and code is concise. Better naming would enhance readability.","tokens":1312,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is straightforward and easy to follow, but method and variable names lack descriptiveness, reducing clarity. Constant naming could be improved.","tokens":1512,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and the logic is clear, but the method name \u0027calc\u0027 and parameter names \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 are not descriptive, reducing readability without context.","tokens":1959,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
