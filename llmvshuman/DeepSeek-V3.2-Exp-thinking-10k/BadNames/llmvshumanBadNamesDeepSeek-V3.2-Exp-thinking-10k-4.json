{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to unclear method and variable names like paprica alecrim and menta Logic is simple but purpose is obscured Code is brief but not self explanatory","tokens":1484,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise with clear Portuguese method names. The ternary operator is straightforward and safely handles division by zero, making it highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names and lack of comments hinder understanding. String manipulations are inefficient, but algorithm logic is decipherable with effort.","tokens":2073,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless and confusing, making the code very hard to understand. Logic is obscured by poor naming and potential errors like calling methods on primitives.","tokens":1908,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Non-descriptive names like tomilho and pimentaCaiena confuse purpose. Magic number 3 and integer division make logic hard to understand without context.","tokens":2242,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code correctly checks for leap years but has poor naming and redundant structure, hindering immediate comprehension.","tokens":1520,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is simple and correct, but method and variable names are not descriptive, reducing clarity and ease of understanding without context.","tokens":1311,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward with a clear calculation, but the method and variable names are not descriptive, making it harder to understand the purpose without context.","tokens":1358,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to non-standard and non-descriptive variable names in Portuguese. Lack of comments and unclear method purposes make comprehension difficult.","tokens":1543,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Non-descriptive Portuguese variable names reduce clarity. Logic involves modulo arithmetic for cyclic behavior, but purpose is obscured by poor naming and lack of comments.","tokens":1580,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
