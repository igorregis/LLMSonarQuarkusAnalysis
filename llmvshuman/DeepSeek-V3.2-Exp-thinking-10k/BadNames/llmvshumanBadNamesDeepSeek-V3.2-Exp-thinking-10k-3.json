{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive method and variable names like paprica alecrim and menta making it hard to understand the purpose The logic with modulo and negation is unclear without context","tokens":1311,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code uses a clear ternary operator to avoid division by zero, but method names in Portuguese may hinder comprehension for non-speakers.","tokens":1262,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable names are unclear (p, s, d), loops are complex with non-standard indexing, and string conversions make logic hard to follow. No comments to aid understanding.","tokens":1912,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses non-descriptive Portuguese variable names, making it hard to understand. Potential type error with int method call. Logic is obscured, reducing readability significantly.","tokens":1510,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method and variable names are unclear and non-descriptive, reducing readability. The logic is mathematically sound but not self-explanatory without context, making comprehension difficult.","tokens":1351,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code uses standard leap year logic with clear structure, but poor naming like isAB and a reduces readability. It is straightforward but could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression.","tokens":1379,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and clear in logic, but the method name calc is vague, and using a custom constant for pi instead of Math.PI reduces readability and accuracy.","tokens":1207,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with a simple calculation, but the method name calc and parameter names a and b are not descriptive, reducing clarity without context.","tokens":1596,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive Portuguese names for methods and variables, making it hard to understand the purpose. The structure is simple, but meaningless identifiers severely reduce readability.","tokens":1302,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic Portuguese variable names such as nozMoscada and oregano which are not descriptive. The method name menta is unclear. While the logic is straightforward, poor naming severely hinders comprehension.","tokens":1408,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
