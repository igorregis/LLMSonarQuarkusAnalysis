{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are non-descriptive and cryptic, making it difficult to understand the code\u0027s purpose. The logic is simple but unclear without context, reducing readability.","tokens":1384,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively, but method names like getBrocolis may be misspelled or unclear, slightly reducing readability.","tokens":1626,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses very short and non descriptive variable names making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic involves complex array indexing and multiple loops without comments explaining the algorithm likely for digit validation. This poor structure and naming reduce readability significantly","tokens":2523,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless and in Portuguese, making code hard to understand. No comments provided. Logic is obscured by poor naming, though structure is standard.","tokens":1420,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method and variable names are cryptic and non descriptive hindering understanding The logic is simple but purpose is unclear without context","tokens":1714,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Logic is correct for leap year check, but method name isAB is vague and parameter a is not descriptive. Code structure is simple but could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression.","tokens":1877,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method and variable names are not descriptive, making the code less readable. Using standard names and Math.PI would improve comprehension.","tokens":1682,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is simple and well-formatted, but variable and method names are not descriptive, making it hard to understand the purpose without context.","tokens":1403,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to cryptic Portuguese variable names that obscure intent. Misuse of DoubleSummaryStatistics with unrelated fields adds confusion, making code hard to understand without context.","tokens":1545,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic Portuguese variable names that obscure purpose, modulo logic is unclear, and missing context for ordinal method, making comprehension very difficult.","tokens":1475,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
