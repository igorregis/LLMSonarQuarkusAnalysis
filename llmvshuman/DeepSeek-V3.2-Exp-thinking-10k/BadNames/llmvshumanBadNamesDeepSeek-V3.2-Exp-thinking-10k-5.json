{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive method and parameter names like paprica and alecrim, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic involves modulo and negation, but poor naming obscures intent.","tokens":1440,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is clear and efficient using ternary operator to avoid division by zero. Portuguese method names are descriptive but may hinder non-speakers. Logic is straightforward and handles edge case well.","tokens":1712,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor variable names, no comments, confusing array indexing, and inefficient string operations make the code hard to understand and follow.","tokens":2036,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable names in Portuguese are unclear and non-standard, hindering comprehension. Potential logical errors, such as method call on int, further reduce readability. Code structure is basic but obscured by poor naming.","tokens":1728,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method and variable names are not descriptive, making intent unclear. The calculation uses integer division for grouping, but context is missing, reducing comprehension.","tokens":1510,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code uses standard leap year logic but the method name isAB is unclear, reducing readability. The structure is simple and easy to follow, though it could be more concise by returning the condition directly.","tokens":1610,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and uses a constant for pi, but method and variable names are vague, reducing readability. Overall easy to understand due to simplicity.","tokens":1451,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and concise with clear arithmetic, but poor method and variable names like calc, a, and b reduce readability and make the intent ambiguous.","tokens":2066,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic Portuguese food names for variables and methods, obscuring functionality. Basic operations are visible but intent is unclear, hindering comprehension.","tokens":3075,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Poor readability due to non-descriptive variable names like menta and nozMoscada, which obscure the code\u0027s purpose. The modulo logic is functional but unclear without better naming and comments.","tokens":4172,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
