{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear comments in Portuguese. The logic is straightforward and follows the standard leap year rule. However, it could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression instead of using if-else, which is a common Java practice. Overall, it is highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1550,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method with good comments and structure, but hardcoded PI instead of Math.PI and Portuguese comments may limit comprehension for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1432,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
