{"score":"9","reasoning":"Concise code with clear Portuguese comments. Easy to understand subtraction via addition and modulo for month rolling. Minimal complexity aids readability.","tokens":3043,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with clear Portuguese method names, simple ternary operator logic, and comprehensive Javadoc documentation explaining behavior and edge cases, making it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1562,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has a clear comment explaining the algorithm, but the use of string arrays and complex indexing reduces readability. Variable names are in Portuguese, which is context-appropriate, but the implementation could be more straightforward with integer operations.","tokens":2796,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code has clear comments and logical flow, but variable declarations at the top and complex conditions like font checks hinder readability. Improvements in scoping and constants would aid comprehension.","tokens":1973,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented with clear Javadoc. However, the method name is in Portuguese, which may reduce readability for non-speakers, and it relies on enum ordinal which is not robust. Easy to understand with the provided comment.","tokens":2481,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear logic and helpful comments. The method name and variable are descriptive. The if-else structure is straightforward, though it could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression.","tokens":1516,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese with clear variable names and simple logic, making it easy to comprehend. Using Math.PI instead of a hard-coded value could slightly improve readability.","tokens":1625,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Highly readable with clear method name, parameters, and comments in Portuguese. Simple logic and good documentation make it easy to understand.","tokens":1210,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear with good naming and structure. Comment in Portuguese is appropriate for context. Logic is easy to follow, though floating-point compensation might need domain knowledge.","tokens":1844,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and well-commented, but variable name amount is vague and the modulo calculation could be clearer for easy comprehension.","tokens":2350,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
