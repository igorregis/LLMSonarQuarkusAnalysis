{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented in Portuguese, making the purpose clear. The logic uses a helper method and modulo operation, which is straightforward with explanation but may cause minor confusion regarding Java\u0027s modulo behavior with negatives.","tokens":3232,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and well-documented. Simple logic using ternary operator handles edge case clearly. Portuguese method names are appropriate in context, aiding readability.","tokens":1456,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Comment explains algorithm clearly, but code uses inefficient string manipulation for numerical tasks and has potential bugs in array indexing and modulo calculation, reducing readability.","tokens":4300,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Method has clear comments and structure. Variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, aiding comprehension for speakers. Logic is straightforward with proper use of loops and conditionals.","tokens":1923,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-commented, making the logic clear. The use of integer division to find the quarter start is efficient, though reliance on ordinal could be fragile. Overall easy to understand for Java developers.","tokens":1682,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear with good comments in Portuguese. Leap year logic is correctly implemented and easy to understand. Slightly verbose but not problematic.","tokens":1624,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese with clear variable names and simple logic making it easy to understand However using Math PI instead of a hardcoded value would improve accuracy and standardization","tokens":1188,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive method and variable names, and simple logic for calculating the area, making it highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1327,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and logical flow. Portuguese comment aids understanding, but sumWithCompensation may need context for full comprehension.","tokens":1584,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear comments in Portuguese, but the modulo calculation is slightly complex and may require extra thought to understand fully.","tokens":2270,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
