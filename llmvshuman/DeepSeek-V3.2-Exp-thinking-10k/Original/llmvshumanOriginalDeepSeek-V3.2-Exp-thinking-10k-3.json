{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise with a clear method name and comprehensive javadoc in Portuguese. It efficiently handles month subtraction using modulo for rollover, making it easy to understand for native speakers.","tokens":2340,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with clear method names, concise ternary operator, and thorough Javadoc explaining behavior and edge cases for easy comprehension.","tokens":1324,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Detailed comment aids comprehension, but code uses confusing array indexing and unnecessary string manipulations, reducing readability. A bug in modulo handling further complicates understanding.","tokens":3371,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code has good comments and descriptive Portuguese variable names, but the font check condition is complex and may hinder readability. Overall clear for Portuguese speakers with moderate comprehension ease.","tokens":1492,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable with a clear method name and detailed comment explaining the logic. The mathematical calculation is efficient, but reliance on ENUMS array and ordinal method may require additional context for full comprehension.","tokens":1825,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear comments and logic, but the if-else block is verbose and can be simplified to a direct return for better conciseness.","tokens":1670,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear with descriptive names and Portuguese comments, aiding comprehension. However, using Math.PI instead of a hardcoded value would enhance readability and align with Java standards.","tokens":1485,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc and inline comments in Portuguese. The method name is descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. Minor point: the formula is general for triangles, not specific to isosceles, but it is correct.","tokens":1438,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code has clear Portuguese documentation and descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand for native speakers. Logic is straightforward, though language mix may slightly hinder universal readability.","tokens":1618,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear variable names and a detailed Portuguese comment. Modulo arithmetic may require extra thought, and using ordinal() could be fragile for maintenance.","tokens":2240,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
