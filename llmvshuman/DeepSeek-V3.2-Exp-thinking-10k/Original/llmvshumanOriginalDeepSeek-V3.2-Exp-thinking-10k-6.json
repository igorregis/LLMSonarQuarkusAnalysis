{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code uses Portuguese names and comments, reducing readability for international teams. Logic is concise but relies on an unseen method, which may obscure understanding without context.","tokens":1696,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely readable code with concise ternary operator, descriptive Portuguese method names, and thorough Javadoc documentation explaining behavior and edge cases.","tokens":2373,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has good comments explaining the algorithm, but the implementation uses inefficient string manipulations and confusing array indices, making it harder to follow. Variable names are in Portuguese, which might affect readability if not familiar.","tokens":2846,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is structured clearly with descriptive variable names in Portuguese, aiding comprehension for native speakers. Comments explain key parts, but the use of Portuguese may limit readability for non-speakers. Logic is straightforward, though the font check could be better documented.","tokens":1841,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-commented in Portuguese, clearly explaining the logic. The use of integer division to determine the quarter start is efficient and standard. Reliance on ordinal may be fragile if enum order changes, but it is acceptable for fixed months. Easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":1371,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Javadoc and inline comments. The logic is standard and easy to follow, though the if-else structure is slightly verbose. Method name is descriptive in Portuguese, appropriate for the context.","tokens":1941,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Highly readable with clear Portuguese comments and descriptive names. Simple structure makes it easy to understand. Minor issue with hard-coded PI instead of Math.PI, but comprehension is excellent.","tokens":1534,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and comments in Portuguese, but inline comments are slightly redundant. Using English would improve readability for broader audiences.","tokens":1579,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear with descriptive names and good documentation. The combine logic is easy to follow, though floating-point compensation might need extra context. High readability.","tokens":1865,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and handles month addition correctly with rollover. However, variable name \u0027amount\u0027 is vague and the modulo arithmetic could be clearer. The Portuguese comment is useful for understanding.","tokens":2128,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
