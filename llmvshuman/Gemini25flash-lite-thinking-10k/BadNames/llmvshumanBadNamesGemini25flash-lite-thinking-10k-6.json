{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code suffers from extremely poor naming conventions using obscure food-related terms for methods and parameters. The logic involving modulo and negation is not intuitive without context, making it very hard to comprehend the purpose or potential side effects. This significantly hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":1260,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is functionally sound preventing division by zero However the use of non standard Portuguese food related method names like getBrocolis getEspinafre and getJaca severely hinders readability and comprehension for developers unfamiliar with the projects specific context or language This naming convention makes the code difficult to understand and maintain","tokens":1712,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variáveis com nomes crípticos (p, d, s, n). Uso ineficiente de array de Strings para operações numéricas. Manipulação complexa de Strings para somar dígitos. Falta de comentários explicando o propósito do algoritmo. Estruturas de loop e indexação confusas. Difícil de entender sem análise profunda.","tokens":2210,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code suffers from extremely poor naming conventions. Variables like coxa, abobora, feijaoVerde, and inhame are Portuguese food items and offer no semantic meaning. This makes the code\u0027s purpose and logic very difficult to decipher, severely impacting readability and maintainability. The use of such obscure names suggests a lack of professionalism or deliberate obfuscation.","tokens":1863,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method and variable names are completely uninformative and use irrelevant Portuguese words. The logic for calculating the index is obscure and requires significant context to understand, making the code very difficult to read and maintain.","tokens":1303,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name isAB and parameter name a are not descriptive, hindering immediate comprehension. The core leap year logic is standard but the redundant if-else structure returning true or false based on a boolean condition could be simplified to a direct return statement for better conciseness and readability.","tokens":1745,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code\u0027s logic is straightforward and easy to grasp. However, generic names like calc, r, and a hinder readability and maintainability. Using Math PI is preferred over the hardcoded value. Comprehension is high due to the snippet\u0027s brevity and simplicity.","tokens":1451,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and its purpose is immediately clear. The calculation is straightforward. However, the method name \u0027calc\u0027 and parameter names \u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027 are generic, which could be more descriptive if the specific domain was known. Overall, high readability.","tokens":866,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for method and variable names making it very hard to understand for non-Portuguese speakers. This violates standard naming conventions and severely impacts readability and maintainability. The logic itself is simple but obscured by poor naming choices.","tokens":1333,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses highly unconventional and non-descriptive names for methods, parameters, and variables (e.g., menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). This makes the logic extremely difficult to follow and understand without significant context. The use of ordinal() suggests an enum, but the overall naming convention obscures the purpose of the calculation, which appears to be an index calculation based on an input value and the enum\u0027s position. The magic number 12 is likely related to months.","tokens":1651,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
