{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is very short and straightforward. Variable names are clear enough and logic is easy to follow. Use of a constant for pi improves readability. Minor issues: method name calc is a bit generic and Math.PI could be preferred over a hardcoded value for pi.","tokens":416,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The logic is straightforward and the condition is clearly structured, making it easy to follow. However, the method name isAB and parameter name a are not descriptive, which hurts readability. The if-else is redundant since it can directly return the boolean expression, so the code could be more concise and self-explanatory.","tokens":460,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variaveis e metodo usam nomes de alimentos sem significado de dominio, prejudicando fortemente a legibilidade. Ha indicio de erro de tipo em feijaoVerde.nextFloat, o que gera confusao. Apesar de a estrutura de controle estar clara, a intencao do metodo permanece opaca.","tokens":934,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Simple structure and formatting make it easy to follow syntactically, but the semantic clarity is very poor. Names like gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, etc, are meaningless for most readers and do not convey intent. Using DoubleSummaryStatistics with such fields is misleading. No comments or hints about purpose, so overall comprehension is limited.","tokens":632,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Very low readability: meaningless variable and method names, reverse and mixed index logic, unnecessary String array and conversions, lack of comments and input validation. Understanding intent (check digit calculation) requires stepping through loops carefully, making maintenance and debugging hard.","tokens":905,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand; arithmetic is clear and structure straightforward. Readability is high, though the method and parameter names are not descriptive, which slightly reduces clarity about the intent of the calculation.","tokens":492,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically clear, but method and array names are meaningless and do not convey intent, making it hard to understand what is being computed with ordinal and the division by 3 without additional context","tokens":643,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Legibilidade prejudicada por nomes de metodo, parametros e variaveis completamente nao descritivos, que escondem a intencao real do codigo. O uso de numero magico 12 sem constante nomeada ou comentario reduz ainda mais a clareza. Em compensacao, o bloco eh curto e a logica aritmetica eh direta, o que evita nota ainda menor","tokens":705,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple one-line method using a ternary operator with clear control flow and no side effects. The structure is easy to follow, but the method names are non-descriptive and domain-specific, which slightly reduces overall readability and makes the intent less obvious.","tokens":508,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically simple, but readability is poor. Method and parameter names are meaningless, offering no clue about intent. The expression menta(-(alecrim % 12)) hides its purpose and the negation of the modulo result is nonobvious without comments or documentation.","tokens":922,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
