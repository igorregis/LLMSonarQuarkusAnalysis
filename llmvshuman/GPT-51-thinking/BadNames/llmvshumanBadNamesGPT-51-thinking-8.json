{"score":"10","reasoning":"Código extremamente simples e legível: nomes curtos mas claros, fórmula direta e constante bem definida. Poderia apenas usar Math.PI para maior precisão, mas isso não reduz a facilidade de compreensão.","tokens":390,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very short and easy to follow, with a straightforward calculation and clear structure. However, the method and parameter names are not descriptive, which slightly reduces readability and self-documentation of intent.","tokens":362,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable and method names do not express intent and misuse DoubleSummaryStatistics making the purpose unclear. Logic is short and structurally simple but hard to understand without domain context or comments so overall readability is low despite clean formatting.","tokens":583,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically clear, but readability is poor due to non descriptive method and parameter names and the unexplained call to menta. The business intent and meaning of the returned Month are impossible to infer from the code alone, which harms maintainability despite the simplicity.","tokens":546,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method and variable names, lack of comments, complex index logic and unnecessary String conversions. The algorithm intent is not obvious, loops run backwards and use 1-based indexing within a 0-based array, which hampers quick comprehension.","tokens":807,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Simple one line method with clear ternary operator and proper formatting Very easy to follow though the domain specific method names are not very descriptive and the repeated getEspinafre call could be less ideal if the method is expensive","tokens":519,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is syntactically simple and short, which helps readability. However, method and variable names (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) are non-descriptive for typical domain logic, there is a magic number (3), and use of ordinal indexing into an array is not self-explanatory. Overall intent is unclear, reducing ease of comprehension.","tokens":583,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear condition and structure, making it easy to understand. However, the method name is not descriptive of its purpose and the boolean logic could be simplified by returning the condition directly, which would slightly improve readability and conciseness.","tokens":586,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Control flow and formatting are straightforward, but readability is very poor. Variable and method names are nonsense in the domain context, which prevents understanding intent. feijaoVerde is declared as int yet used as if it had nextFloat, suggesting either an error or misleading naming. Overall logic is guessable but not clear or self documenting.","tokens":874,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Logic is simple and short, but readability is harmed by meaningless method and variable names and lack of comments or context. The modulo arithmetic is not self explanatory and pimentaCaiena array or ordinal usage is unclear, forcing extra mental effort to infer intent.","tokens":710,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
