{"score":"9","reasoning":"Codigo extremamente simples e legivel. Uso adequado de constante para PI e calculo direto da area. Poderia ser levemente melhorado com nomes mais descritivos, como usar PI em vez de P e area em vez de a, e um nome de metodo mais claro como calcArea, mas ainda assim e muito facil de compreender.","tokens":386,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The logic is straightforward and properly indented, using clear boolean conditions. However, the method name isAB and the parameter name a are not descriptive, which hurts readability. The explicit if-else could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly, further improving clarity.","tokens":430,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Low readability: method and variable names are cryptic, giving no clue about the purpose (likely a check-digit calculation). No comments or explanation of the algorithm, several magic numbers, heavy and confusing use of String/Integer conversions. Control flow is simple and indented correctly, which avoids an even lower score.","tokens":728,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very simple and readable; the formula is straightforward. However, method and parameter names are too generic and do not clearly express intent (e.g., base, height, areaTriangle). No comments or Javadoc, but given the size this is minor. Overall, it is easy to understand and maintain.","tokens":525,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically clear, but names paprica, alecrim and menta are non descriptive, hiding the intent. No comments or javadoc to explain why Month is derived from a negated modulo 12 calculation. Overall understandable structure but low semantic clarity.","tokens":593,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple, short method and clear control flow using the ternary operator. However, the domain meaning of method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre and getJaca is not obvious, which slightly hurts readability. Overall still easy to understand from a technical perspective.","tokens":614,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Very short and structurally simple, but variable and method names are meaningless and misleading, making the intent of the modulo and array access hard to infer. Lack of comments or documentation further hurts readability and maintainability.","tokens":713,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically simple, but method and array names are non descriptive, hiding the intent of computing the first month of a quarter. Use of ordinal and magic constants 3 reduces clarity and maintainability. With better naming and a small comment, readability would increase greatly.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Names and method purpose are unclear which makes understanding intent difficult despite simple structure and good formatting Code flow is easy but domain meaning is completely opaque and use of DoubleSummaryStatistics with custom fields adds confusion","tokens":954,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable and method names are meaningless and hide intent, no comments, loop and control flow are simple but hard to understand due to naming, suspicious expression feijaoVerde.nextFloat suggests errors and further harms readability","tokens":1220,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
