{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is syntactically simple but hard to follow due to very short variable names, reversed loops with non intuitive indices, unnecessary String array, magic numbers and absence of comments, which all reduce readability and comprehension","tokens":783,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very readable and concise. Simple math expression, consistent formatting, and clear structure. However, method and variable names are somewhat generic; more descriptive names like calculateArea, pi, and area would further improve clarity.","tokens":552,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very simple and readable; the logic is obvious. However, the method name calc and parameters a and b are generic and not descriptive, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall, the code is still very easy to understand.","tokens":428,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Codigo curto e direto, mas o nome do metodo e do array nao sao descritivos para o dominio, o que reduz clareza. A logica com ordinal/3*3 exige algum raciocinio para entender o proposito, embora seja simples para quem conhece enums em Java. No geral, legivel mas poderia ser mais explicito.","tokens":562,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Although the method is short and structurally simple, the use of non descriptive and inconsistent names for method, parameter and fields severely hurts readability. The type DoubleSummaryStatistics with custom field names is misleading, so understanding intent requires guessing. Indentation and use of Math.min and Math.max are fine but overall clarity is low.","tokens":683,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and easy to follow. The ternary operator is simple and clear. However, the use of non descriptive method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre and getJaca slightly reduces semantic clarity, forcing the reader to infer intent from context rather than names.","tokens":693,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Although the logic is simple and short, the method, parameter, variable, and array names are semantically meaningless, harming clarity. Magic number 12 is unexplained, and there are no comments or context to indicate it is about month arithmetic. Overall, easy to follow mechanically but hard to understand intent.","tokens":515,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Logic is straightforward and condition is clearly written with proper indentation, so it is easy to follow. However, the method and parameter names (isAB, a) are not descriptive, and the explicit if/else returning true/false is redundant and slightly hurts clarity. Overall, readable but could be improved with better naming and simplification.","tokens":711,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"O código tem estrutura simples e boa indentação, porém os nomes de método e variáveis são totalmente não descritivos e não refletem o domínio, o que dificulta muito entender a intenção. Há ainda uso de constante mágica e aparente erro de tipo em feijaoVerde.nextFloat, sem comentários que ajudem na compreensão.","tokens":913,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is syntactically simple but readability is low due to non descriptive method and parameter names and lack of context for menta and Month. Logic of modulo and negation is clear yet intent is obscure, so overall understanding requires guessing the business meaning.","tokens":841,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
