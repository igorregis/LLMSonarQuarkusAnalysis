{"score":"10","reasoning":"Simple, clear method and parameters. The formula is straightforward with no unnecessary complexity, making the code very easy to read and understand.","tokens":386,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is short and structurally clear but uses misleading type (DoubleSummaryStatistics) and nonsensical, domain unrelated names for method, parameter and fields, making intent very hard to understand. Lack of comments or context further hurts readability, so overall comprehension is low.","tokens":587,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very short and easy to understand method, straightforward calculation and simple structure. Readability is high. Minor improvements would be using Math.PI instead of a hard coded value and more descriptive names for method and variables, such as calculateArea, radius, and area","tokens":568,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Names of method and array are not descriptive, logic using ordinal division by 3 is cryptic, no comments or documentation, magic number 3 harms clarity. Very short but not self explanatory, so readability and ease of comprehension are low","tokens":619,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Codigo curto e simples, mas nomes de metodo, parametro e variavel nao sao descritivos e dificultam entender o proposito. Estrutura e aritmetica sao claras, mas seria bem mais legivel com nomes significativos e algum comentario explicando o calculo do mes resultante.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very short and clear method with a simple ternary operation, easy to follow. Readability is high, but the domain method names (vegetable names) are not descriptive of their real intent, which slightly reduces overall comprehension.","tokens":597,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Simple and correctly formatted conditional, indentation and structure are clear. However, the method name isAB and parameter name a are not descriptive, so the intent of the code is not obvious. The boolean return could be simplified to returning the condition directly, which would also improve readability slightly.","tokens":583,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method and variable names, reverse index loops, unnecessary String array and conversions, and non intuitive control flow. Logic can be followed with effort, but lacks comments and clear structure, making the intent of the algorithm hard to grasp quickly.","tokens":933,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Names are not descriptive and domain meaning is unclear, magic number 12 and negated modulo obscure intent, though the code is short and syntactically simple","tokens":827,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Codigo curto e com estrutura simples, mas a legibilidade e baixa: nomes de metodo, variaveis e constantes nao descrevem o dominio, parecendo aleatorios, o que dificulta entender a intencao. Alem disso, feijaoVerde e int mas e usado com nextFloat, o que torna o fluxo ainda mais confuso.","tokens":1520,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
