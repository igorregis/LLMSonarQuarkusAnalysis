{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very readable and simple. Clear structure and straightforward logic. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI and more descriptive names for the method, constant, and variable a to better convey that this calculates a circle area.","tokens":483,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very simple and readable method. Clear calculation and straightforward return. Minor issue is parameter naming and ordering which could be more descriptive to improve understanding of the formula context but overall extremely easy to comprehend.","tokens":405,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Simple and concise one line method, clear control flow using a ternary operator and proper types. However, the method and helper names are not self explanatory about their real intent, which hurts semantic readability in a real business context.","tokens":514,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Very short and syntactically simple, but method and array names are non descriptive. The arithmetic using ordinal and the magic numbers 3 and 3 makes the intent unclear without additional context or comments, reducing readability and ease of comprehension.","tokens":553,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Simple one line method but very low semantic clarity. Method, parameter and called method names are non descriptive, making purpose hard to infer. The modulus with negation adds cognitive load without comments or context. Overall easy to parse syntactically but hard to understand intent.","tokens":516,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Clear and simple conditional structure, easy to follow. However method and parameter names are meaningless and do not convey intent, which hurts readability. Could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly without if-else. Overall quite readable but naming prevents a higher score.","tokens":648,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"O método é curto e simples, com estrutura clara e sem complexidade de controle de fluxo, o que ajuda na leitura. Porém, todos os nomes de método, parâmetros e campos são metafóricos (nomes de alimentos) e não revelam intenção ou domínio, o que prejudica fortemente a compreensão. Não há comentários nem contexto sobre DoubleSummaryStatistics personalizado.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Nomes de variaveis e do metodo pouco descritivos dv p s d d1 d2 dificultam entender a intencao. Lacos reversos e uso de array com comprimento length mais um tornam o fluxo confuso. Falta de comentarios e de extracao de metodos auxiliares reduz muito a legibilidade embora a logica pareca consistente.","tokens":957,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code logic is simple and compact, making the flow itself easy to follow. However, readability suffers due to non-descriptive method and variable names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena), which do not convey domain intent. Use of magic number 12 without explanation also reduces clarity. Overall understandable but not clean or self-explanatory.","tokens":671,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable and method names use arbitrary food related words that hide their purpose, making the intent of the code very hard to understand. Although indentation and control flow are straightforward, the semantic obscurity and apparent type misuse severely hurt readability. A new maintainer would struggle to infer the real behavior.","tokens":901,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
