{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple and syntactically clear, but readability is significantly harmed by non-descriptive names (paprica, alecrim, menta). There are no comments or hints about intent, and the negative modulus logic is non-obvious without context. Overall easy to parse, hard to understand purpose.","tokens":412,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is simple and easy to follow with clear conditional structure, but the method name is not descriptive and the boolean expression could be returned directly without the if else block, which would improve readability","tokens":534,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Very simple and readable. Short method with straightforward calculation and no nesting. However, method name calc and parameter names a, b, r are not very descriptive, which slightly hurts self documentation. Overall still extremely easy to understand.","tokens":563,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is clear and easy to understand, with simple logic and good use of a constant, but the constant name P is not very descriptive and using Math.PI plus a more explicit method name would further improve readability","tokens":600,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is short and syntactically simple, which helps, but readability is harmed by non descriptive method and array names and a magic arithmetic expression using ordinal. The intent of grouping or mapping months is not obvious without comments or better naming, so overall comprehension is limited despite brevity.","tokens":665,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Logic and control flow are simple and concise, but readability is hurt by nonintuitive names for method, parameters, and array, which obscure the intent of performing a month offset. No comments or documentation, use of magic number 12 and ordinal makes understanding harder for anyone not already familiar with the surrounding enum or context.","tokens":596,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is short and structurally simple, with clear arithmetic and method calls, but the vegetable based names do not convey intent or domain meaning. Parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics is misleading versus the apparent custom fields. Lack of comments and context reduces overall readability and ease of understanding.","tokens":777,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable names are cryptic and single letter, making the intent unclear. Loops iterate backwards with non obvious index usage, and the String array for digit math is unintuitive. There are no comments to explain the algorithm or magic numbers. While formatting is acceptable, overall readability and ease of comprehension are poor.","tokens":776,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Poor readability due to meaningless method and variable names, making intent unclear. Types are confusing, feijaoVerde is an int but used as if it were a Random object. While control flow and formatting are straightforward, the lack of domain naming and potential compile issue make comprehension hard.","tokens":901,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Logic is straightforward and concise; the ternary operator is simple to follow. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre and getJaca are not self-explanatory about their purpose, which harms semantic clarity. Structurally it is easy to read, but domain intent is unclear, so overall readability is moderate to good.","tokens":817,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
