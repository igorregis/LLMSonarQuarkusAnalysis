{"score":"6","reasoning":"Function is concise and intent somewhat clear: computes negative remainder and returns a Month via menta. Lack of context: unclear names (paprica, alecrim, menta) reduce readability. No types for Month or menta provided, no comments. Use of negative remainder may be surprising; consider clearer naming and handling of negative values.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses ternary for null-safe division which aids readability, but method and variable names are non descriptive and in Portuguese mixed terms reducing clarity. Repeated calls to getters may have side effects or performance impact. Lack of Javadoc and edge case handling (NaN/Infinity) slightly lowers comprehension.","tokens":277,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Código funcional e usa técnicas conhecidas (duplicar dígitos alternados e soma de dígitos) mas tem problemas de legibilidade: nomes de variáveis curtos e pouco descritivos, índices confusos e manipulação de strings para números, arrays com tamanho p.length()+1 e loops com limites inconsistentes que dificultam compreensão e mantibilidade","tokens":501,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable and method names are obfuscated and non descriptive making comprehension hard. Mixed Portuguese and English and meaningless names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde) hinder intent. Structure is simple and consistent but use of unclear globals and magic constants reduces readability. Minor control flow clarity but overall low readability.","tokens":495,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses concise arithmetic to compute index. Readability suffers from unclear names pimentaCaiena and tomilho and hidden context of ordinal and array bounds. Lack of comments and potential for IndexOutOfBounds reduce clarity. Overall logic is compact but not self-explanatory.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is clear, concise and follows standard convention for leap year check. Naming could be improved (isLeapYear) and redundant if-else can be simplified to return the boolean expression directly. Formatting and logic are correct and easy to read.","tokens":279,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Código curto e direto, nomes claros e uso de final para constante. Poderia melhorar padronizando nome da constante para PI e usar Math.PI para precisão. Espaçamento e formatação estão bons. Comentários não necessários dado a simplicidade.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear with meaningful names and a simple return. Minor issues: parameter order b,a is nonstandard and could be named more descriptively; unnecessary local variable r could be inlined. Otherwise readable and easy to understand.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Names are nonstandard and mix languages making intent unclear. Small method is concise but uses unclear field access on parameter and side effects without null checks. Inconsistent naming and missing types for fields reduce readability. Structure is simple but semantic clarity is low.","tokens":312,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and intent is clear: computes an index offset safely using modulo and returns array element. Naming uses Portuguese spice words which may be domain specific but consistent. Minor issues: cast from long to int without checks and magic number 12 repeated; could use descriptive constant and bounds validation to improve clarity.","tokens":288,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
