{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is short and clear in intent but uses obfuscated names (paprica, alecrim, menta) which hurt readability. Single expression return is fine. Lack of parameter validation and unclear modulus behavior for negatives reduces clarity. Context of Month type and menta implementation needed for full comprehension.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is short and clear with a straightforward ternary for division guarded against zero. Method and variable names are nonstandard and not English which reduces readability. Use of redundant 0.0d and calling getters twice could be improved by local variable and clearer naming. No null checks shown.","tokens":272,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is functional and implements a digit check algorithm but uses confusing indexing, unnecessary String array, boxing overhead and inconsistent loops. Variable names are terse. Lack of comments and edge case handling reduce readability. Refactoring with ints, clearer indices and names would improve comprehension.","tokens":480,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Variable and method names are obfuscated with unrelated Portuguese words, harming readability and intent. Structure and control flow are simple and clear, but unclear names for fields like aipo, aspargos, MILHOS, and feijaoVerde.nextFloat() cause confusion. Consistent formatting is good but lack of comments and misleading identifiers reduce comprehension.","tokens":503,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Código curto e direto, fácil de entender a intenção: retorna um elemento de um array baseado em ordinal dividido por 3. Nomes de métodos e variáveis misturam idiomas e são confusos (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) o que prejudica leitura. Ausência de contexto e verificações nulas/limites reduz robustez mais do que clareza","tokens":276,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear leap year logic with explicit condition. Readability is high but can be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly and parameter name could be more descriptive. No comments but logic is standard and easy to follow.","tokens":278,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear with meaningful names and use of final for constant. Minor issues: constant P should be named PI and use Math.PI; parameter r could be named radius; method could validate negative input and include javadoc. Overall highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear with meaningful names and correct simple computation. Minor issues: parameter order a and b could be named more descriptively and method name calc is generic. Also redundant local variable r could be inlined. Overall easy to read and understand.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is short and mostly readable but uses nonstandard names mixing languages and unclear field access on DoubleSummaryStatistics which is surprising. Lack of types for fields and method context reduces clarity. Reasonably understandable flow but naming and unusual API usage hurt comprehension.","tokens":311,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and intent is clear: map a long to a Month via modulo with safe cast. Naming is whimsical but consistent; use of +12 is redundant due to modulo but harmless. Minor clarity issues: magic constant 12, cast without validation, and reliance on pimentaCaiena array and ordinal() context. Readability good but could be clearer.","tokens":299,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
