{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely obscure and meaningless variable and method names (paprica, alecrim, menta). It\u0027s impossible to understand the purpose or logic without external context. This violates fundamental readability principles.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and functional, but the method and variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are in Portuguese and not descriptive of their actual purpose in a typical software context. This significantly hinders readability for non-Portuguese speakers or those unfamiliar with the domain. The ternary operator is used correctly but could be slightly more explicit with an if-else for clarity.","tokens":294,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses very short and cryptic variable names (dv, p, s, d, d1, d2) making it hard to understand the purpose of each. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations that obscure the intended algorithm. It\u0027s difficult to follow the flow and the overall intent without significant effort.","tokens":540,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely obscure and unrelated variable and method names (e.g., \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027, \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027). This makes it nearly impossible to understand the purpose of the code without extensive external context. The logic itself is not overly complex, but the naming renders it unreadable.","tokens":533,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely cryptic method and variable names (\u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, \u0027ordinal\u0027). It\u0027s impossible to understand the purpose or logic without external context. This lack of clarity severely hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"O código é conciso e implementa corretamente a lógica para determinar se um ano é bissexto. A condição é clara e segue as regras padrão. A única melhoria seria simplificar o retorno, removendo o if/else explícito e retornando diretamente a expressão booleana.","tokens":302,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and directly calculates the area of a circle. Variable names are clear and the logic is straightforward. The use of a constant for Pi is good practice. It\u0027s easy to understand for anyone familiar with basic geometry and Java.","tokens":268,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. Variable names are short but contextually clear. The logic is straightforward, performing a basic arithmetic calculation. No complex constructs or obscure features are used, making it highly readable.","tokens":254,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable and method names in Portuguese (gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, tomate, pepino, alecrim, berinjela). This makes the code extremely difficult to understand for anyone not familiar with this specific, bizarre naming convention. It violates basic principles of clear and maintainable code.","tokens":351,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses highly obscure and irrelevant variable and method names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). This makes it extremely difficult to understand the purpose of the code without external context. The logic itself is somewhat convoluted due to the naming.","tokens":291,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
