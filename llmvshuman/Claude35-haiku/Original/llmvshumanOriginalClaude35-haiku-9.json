{"score":"9","reasoning":"High-quality code with clear Portuguese documentation explaining method behavior, concise implementation, handles negative scenarios, uses modulo for cyclic month calculation, immutability is highlighted, and follows good naming conventions","tokens":392,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with clear documentation explaining its purpose. Uses ternary operator for compact logic, handles zero case elegantly, follows good practices with descriptive method name and javadoc comments explaining special behaviors and precision considerations.","tokens":417,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code implements a complex Modulo 10 algorithm for bank slip verification digit calculation with clear comments explaining the logic. Good documentation and algorithmic approach. However, it has some readability challenges with multiple nested loops and type conversions that could be simplified for better comprehension.","tokens":1062,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code demonstrates good practices with clear comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose. It uses meaningful variable names and has a structured approach to creating child nodes. The code handles font and color selection logically. However, the nested conditionals and direct array access could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.","tokens":659,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Excellent code with clear documentation explaining the method\u0027s purpose. Uses concise and efficient logic with enum manipulation. The comments provide a precise description of the trimester calculation, making the code easily understandable for developers.","tokens":429,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise with a well-documented method for checking leap years. The logic is straightforward and follows the standard leap year calculation rules. The method name is descriptive and the comments explain the implementation. Minor improvement could be a more compact return statement.","tokens":393,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and well-structured method with clear documentation, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward implementation. Uses a constant for PI and includes descriptive comments. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value.","tokens":382,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Excellent code readability with clear Portuguese comments, descriptive method name, proper JavaDoc documentation, simple and straightforward implementation, follows best practices for method design and calculation logic","tokens":371,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates good readability with clear method documentation in Portuguese, explicit parameter handling, and concise implementation of statistical combination logic. Uses meaningful method and variable names, follows Java conventions, and handles edge cases like null checks.","tokens":402,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"High-quality method with clear documentation, concise implementation, handles month rollover elegantly, uses modulo arithmetic effectively, supports positive and negative month shifts, and ensures immutability","tokens":408,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
