{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to unclear method purpose, lack of input validation, and potential integer overflow. The method seems to subtract months but uses a modulo operation in an unconventional way. No comments explain the logic, and the method signature lacks type safety and clear intent.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with good use of ternary operator. Handles division by zero scenario elegantly. Method name suggests calculating average. Compact implementation with clear logic. Slight improvement could be explicit null checks or more descriptive variable names.","tokens":278,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has moderate readability with complex nested loops and multiple type conversions. Variable names are descriptive but the algorithm\u0027s logic is not immediately clear. The method lacks comments explaining the calculation process and uses multiple string manipulations which reduce code clarity and performance.","tokens":559,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code demonstrates good structure with clear variable naming and logical flow. It uses a consistent pattern for creating tree nodes with alternating colors. However, the method could benefit from more explicit error handling and comments explaining the purpose of random name generation and node insertion.","tokens":528,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with good use of enum arithmetic. The code is compact and demonstrates a smart way to calculate the first month of a quarter. Slight deduction for lack of comments explaining the logic behind the calculation.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method for checking leap year. Uses standard leap year calculation logic with clear modulo operations. Could be simplified by directly returning boolean expression, but overall readable and follows good Java practices.","tokens":300,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and straightforward method with clear purpose. Uses meaningful variable names, follows single responsibility principle. Calculates circle area with constant PI. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI instead of hardcoded value. Code is concise and easily understandable.","tokens":290,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clean, concise and follows good naming conventions. The method name clearly describes its purpose, parameters are well-defined, and the calculation is straightforward. Minor improvements could include input validation and potential use of Math.abs() for base and height.","tokens":283,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean method with clear intent for combining statistical data. Uses standard Java Math methods, follows good naming conventions, and demonstrates a concise approach to merging summary statistics with compensation for potential floating-point precision issues.","tokens":324,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clean and concise method with clear logic for month calculation. Uses modulo arithmetic effectively. Handles potential negative month offsets. Readable and demonstrates good use of enum operations. Slight complexity in calculation might require careful reading.","tokens":282,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
