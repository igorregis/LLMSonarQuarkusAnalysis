{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method and parameter names. Unclear purpose of method, uses modulo operation and negation without context. Lacks meaningful comments or clear intent. Method signature suggests returning a Month but implementation is not straightforward.","tokens":266,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code has a concise ternary operation but lacks clarity in method naming and purpose. The method name and parameter references are not descriptive, making comprehension difficult. The logic seems cryptic without context, reducing readability and maintainability.","tokens":284,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks clear naming conventions and has complex nested loops making comprehension difficult. Variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027p\u0027 are not descriptive, and the algorithm seems to perform some validation or calculation without clear comments explaining its purpose. The multiple type conversions and complex indexing reduce code readability and maintainability.","tokens":556,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic variable names, unclear method purpose, and potential null pointer risks. Complex logic with nested conditions and random index generation makes comprehension difficult. Naming conventions are inconsistent and method lacks proper documentation or comments explaining its functionality.","tokens":541,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method name tomilho, unclear purpose of the method, non-descriptive variable names, and complex array indexing calculation that requires mental effort to understand the logic and intent.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is a clear implementation of leap year calculation with good logical structure. Uses modulo operations effectively. Could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, reducing unnecessary if-else complexity.","tokens":293,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable naming and a concise implementation of circle area calculation. However, it could be improved by using Math.PI constant and adding input validation for radius.","tokens":269,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable names and a basic mathematical calculation. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. The method is concise and follows standard Java conventions, though it could benefit from a more descriptive method name and potential input validation.","tokens":288,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic method and variable names. Purpose is unclear, method seems to perform arithmetic operations on various ingredients. No type safety, no comments, no context about what the method does or represents. Naming convention is poor and method lacks proper documentation.","tokens":350,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic method and variable names. The logic seems complex and not immediately understandable. Method signature is unclear about its purpose. Potential type casting and modulo operations make comprehension difficult. Naming conventions are not following standard Java practices.","tokens":294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
