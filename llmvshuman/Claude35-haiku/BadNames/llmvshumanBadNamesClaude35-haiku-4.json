{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method and parameter names. Unclear purpose of method, uses modulo operation and negation without context. Lacks meaningful comments or clear intent. Method signature suggests returning a Month but implementation is not straightforward.","tokens":266,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code has a concise ternary operation but lacks clarity in method naming and purpose. The method name and parameter references are not descriptive, making comprehension difficult. The logic seems cryptic without context, reducing readability and maintainability.","tokens":284,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks clear naming conventions and has complex nested loops making comprehension difficult. Variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027p\u0027 are not descriptive, and the algorithm seems to perform some validation or calculation without clear comments explaining its purpose. The multiple type conversions and complex indexing reduce code readability and maintainability.","tokens":556,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic variable names, unclear method purpose, and potential null pointer risks. Complex logic with nested conditions and random index generation makes comprehension difficult. Naming conventions are inconsistent and method lacks proper documentation or comments explaining its functionality.","tokens":541,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Low readability due to cryptic method name, unclear purpose, and non-descriptive variable usage. The code lacks meaningful context, type safety concerns, and does not follow clear naming conventions or provide any documentation about its intended functionality.","tokens":267,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is a clear implementation of leap year calculation with straightforward logic. The method name and parameter are descriptive. However, the explicit return of true/false can be simplified to a direct return of the condition, which would improve conciseness.","tokens":306,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable naming and a concise implementation of circle area calculation. Uses a constant for PI and follows basic mathematical logic. Minor improvements could include using Math.PI and adding input validation.","tokens":274,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable names and a basic mathematical calculation. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. The method is concise and performs a single, clear operation. Minor improvements could include adding a comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose.","tokens":287,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic method and variable names. Purpose is unclear, method seems to perform arithmetic operations on various ingredients. No type safety, no comments, no context about what the method does or represents. Naming convention is poor and method lacks proper documentation.","tokens":350,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Code lacks clarity with cryptic method and variable names. The logic seems complex and not immediately understandable. Method signature is unclear about its purpose. Potential type casting and modulo operations make comprehension difficult. Naming conventions are not following standard Java practices.","tokens":294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
