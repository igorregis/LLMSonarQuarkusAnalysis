{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The use of modulo operation is efficient. Javadoc is well-written, explaining the method\u0027s behavior, including edge cases and immutability.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the function\u0027s purpose, behavior, and potential numerical variations. The use of a ternary operator makes the logic clear: return the average if there are values, otherwise return 0.0d.","tokens":377,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings for integer calculations makes it harder to follow. The logic, although explained in the comments, is implemented in a convoluted way, impacting comprehension.","tokens":946,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, but the comments are in Portuguese, which might limit understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, involving a loop and some conditional assignments. The comment about `add()` vs `insert()` is helpful.","tokens":576,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear, explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior with examples. Only lacks type and name of the ENUMS array.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and purpose, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability.","tokens":337,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code itself is a straightforward implementation of a simple formula, with comments explaining each step, variable names are meaningful.","tokens":354,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented in Portuguese, with clear Javadoc explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and potential exceptions. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 is intuitive, and the code logic is straightforward, using standard mathematical operations.","tokens":358,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The logic is concise and uses a clear approach with the modulo operator. The variable names are meaningful. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief comment explaining the `ENUMS` array.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
