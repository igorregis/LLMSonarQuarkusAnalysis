{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise implementation and clear Javadoc. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The use of modulo operation is efficient. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief inline comment explaining the modulo operation.","tokens":356,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Excellent Javadoc documentation explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, potential numerical variations, and providing a cross-reference. The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively for a clear conditional return.","tokens":360,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow than necessary. The variable names are okay, and the comments explain the algorithm well, which helps in understanding.","tokens":946,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for native speakers, might hinder understanding for a broader audience. Variable names are also in Portuguese. The logic is clear, with a loop creating child nodes and assigning random names and colors. The comment about `add()` vs. `insert()` is helpful.","tokens":587,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is clear, leveraging integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is well-written and explains the method\u0027s purpose and behavior effectively in Portuguese.","tokens":366,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is well-defined by Javadoc.","tokens":338,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code uses meaningful variable names and the formula implementation is straightforward.","tokens":344,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented in Portuguese, with clear Javadoc explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 is intuitive, and the logic is straightforward, using standard mathematical operations. Variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":359,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The logic is concise and uses a clever modulo operation to handle month wrapping. The variable names are clear, and the comments explain the method\u0027s purpose and behavior, including edge cases.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
