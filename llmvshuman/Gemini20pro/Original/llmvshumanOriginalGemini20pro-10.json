{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and parameter name \u0027meses\u0027 are intuitive (for Portuguese speakers). The use of modulo operator is efficient. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief javadoc to \u0027soma\u0027.","tokens":362,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Excellent Javadoc documentation explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, potential numerical variations, and providing a cross-reference. The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively for a clear conditional return.","tokens":360,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow. The variable names are good and the comments explain the algorithm, improving the overall understanding, but the implementation is not straightforward.","tokens":949,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has decent readability but suffers from a few issues. Variable names are in Portuguese, which might limit understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. The comment explaining not to use \u0027add()\u0027 is helpful but also suggests a potential design flaw. The logic is slightly complex with the conditional font and color assignments.","tokens":582,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient, using a clever calculation based on the ordinal value of the enum. The Javadoc is well-written and explains the purpose and behavior of the method clearly in Portuguese. Only a perfect 10 would require zero effort to understand.","tokens":376,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is perfectly clear, concise, and well-documented. It implements the leap year check correctly, using a single `if` statement with a clear condition. The comments explain the logic and purpose, variable name is meaningful.","tokens":371,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The function does exactly what the Javadoc describes.","tokens":337,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It uses descriptive variable names in Portuguese, includes a concise Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value, and the calculation itself is straightforward.","tokens":345,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose and parameters. Variable names are meaningful (count, simpleSum, sum, etc.). The logic is straightforward and easy to follow, using standard mathematical operations.","tokens":356,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear algorithm. The comments are well-written and explain the purpose, behavior, and constraints of the method effectively, including edge cases and immutability. Only a minor improvement could be renaming \u0027amount\u0027 to something more descriptive.","tokens":379,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
