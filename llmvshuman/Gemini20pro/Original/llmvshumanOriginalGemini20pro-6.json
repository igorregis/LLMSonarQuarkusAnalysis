{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The use of modulo operation is efficient. Javadoc is well-written, explaining the method\u0027s behavior, including edge cases and immutability.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very clear and concise. The method name `getMedia` is intuitive (for Portuguese speakers). The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the purpose, behavior, and potential numerical considerations. The use of a ternary operator makes the logic compact and easy to follow.","tokens":375,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses String manipulation for numeric calculations, which is inefficient. The logic, while functional, could be simplified and made more readable by using integer arithmetic directly. Array indexing and loop conditions are slightly complex.","tokens":942,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for native speakers, might hinder understanding for others. Variable names are mostly clear, and the logic is straightforward, using a loop and conditional statements to create tree nodes.","tokens":569,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear and well-written in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior effectively.","tokens":368,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule. The conditional statement is easy to follow.","tokens":368,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and purpose, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability.","tokens":337,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle. The comments are clear, concise, and written in Portuguese, matching the prompt\u0027s language. The variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":345,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, explaining the function\u0027s purpose and parameter. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 is clear, and the logic within is straightforward, using standard mathematical operations. Variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":357,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever modulo operation for month wrapping. However, the reliance on `ENUMS` and `ordinal()` without context slightly reduces readability. The Javadoc is well-written and explains the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and behavior, including edge cases, enhancing comprehension.","tokens":386,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
