{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise implementation and clear Javadoc. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The logic is straightforward, using modulo operation for year wraparound. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief inline comment explaining the modulo operation.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the function\u0027s purpose, behavior, and potential numerical variations. The use of a ternary operator makes the logic clear: return the average if there are values, otherwise return 0.0d.","tokens":377,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow. The variable names are in Portuguese, which might limit understanding for a broader audience. The algorithm explanation is well documented.","tokens":948,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for native speakers, might hinder understanding for a broader audience. Variable names are also in Portuguese. The logic is clear, with a loop creating child nodes and assigning random names and colors. The comment about `add()` vs. `insert()` is helpful.","tokens":587,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear, explaining the purpose and behavior of the method in Portuguese. Only minor improvement could be renaming ENUMS to something more descriptive.","tokens":376,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is perfectly readable. The function name, comments, and variable names are clear and concise. The logic is straightforward and easy to understand, implementing the leap year rule correctly.","tokens":361,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and purpose, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability.","tokens":337,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code itself is a straightforward implementation of a simple formula, with comments explaining each step, variable names are meaningful.","tokens":354,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented in Portuguese, uses clear variable names, and has a straightforward logic. The method\u0027s purpose is clearly stated, and the implementation is easy to follow.","tokens":348,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The logic is concise and uses the modulo operator effectively. The variable names are clear, and the comments explain the method\u0027s purpose and behavior, including edge cases. Only small improvement could be renaming \u0027amount\u0027 variable.","tokens":381,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
