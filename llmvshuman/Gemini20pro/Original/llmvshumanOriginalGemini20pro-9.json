{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The use of modulo operation is efficient. Javadoc is well-written, explaining the method\u0027s behavior, including edge cases and immutability.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. Uses clear Javadoc, explains the function\u0027s purpose, potential numerical variations, and provides a reference. The logic is straightforward: it calculates the average or returns 0 if no values are present.","tokens":365,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow. The variable names are good and the comments explain the algorithm, but the implementation itself is a bit convoluted, impacting the overall score.","tokens":951,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for Portuguese speakers, might hinder understanding for a broader audience. Variable names are also in Portuguese. The logic is clear, with a loop creating child nodes and assigning random names and colors.","tokens":573,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Excellent code. Clear Javadoc in Portuguese explains the method\u0027s purpose and behavior. Uses a concise and efficient calculation to determine the first month of the quarter. The use of ENUMS enhances readability.","tokens":364,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining the purpose and parameters, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule.","tokens":362,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is well-defined by its Javadoc comment.","tokens":340,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code itself is a straightforward implementation of a simple formula, with comments explaining each step, variable names are meaningful.","tokens":354,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, explaining the purpose of the `combine` method and its parameter. The method name and variable names are clear and concise. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":354,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever modulo operation for month calculation. However, the reliance on `ENUMS` and `ordinal()` without context slightly reduces readability. The Javadoc is well-written and in Portuguese, aiding comprehension for Portuguese speakers.","tokens":376,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
