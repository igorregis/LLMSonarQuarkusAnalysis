{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise implementation and clear Javadoc. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) directly relates to its function. The logic is straightforward, using modulo operation for year wrap-around. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief inline comment explaining the modulo operation.","tokens":365,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the function\u0027s purpose, behavior, and potential numerical variations. The use of a ternary operator makes the logic clear: return the average if there are values, otherwise return 0.0d.","tokens":377,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code implements a specific algorithm (Modulo 10). The logic is slightly complex due to string manipulations and the algorithm itself. Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., \u0027num\u0027 could be \u0027inputNumber\u0027). The use of a String array to store intermediate integer results is not optimal.","tokens":962,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively readable, with clear variable names in Portuguese. The logic is straightforward, iterating to create child nodes. However, the comment warning against using \u0027add()\u0027 is slightly confusing, and the magic number \u00272\u0027 could be replaced with a named constant for better clarity.","tokens":576,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear, explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior with examples. Only lacks type and name of the ENUMS variable.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is well-defined by Javadoc.","tokens":338,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code itself is a straightforward implementation of a simple formula, with comments explaining each step. Variable names are meaningful.","tokens":354,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose and parameters. Variable names are descriptive (count, simpleSum, etc.). The logic is straightforward and easy to follow, using standard mathematical operations.","tokens":354,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever modulo operation for month wrapping. However, the reliance on `ENUMS` and `ordinal()` without context slightly reduces readability. The Javadoc is well-written and in Portuguese, which is consistent.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
