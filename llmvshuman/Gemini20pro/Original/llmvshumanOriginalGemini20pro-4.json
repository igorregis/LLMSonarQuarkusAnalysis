{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and parameter name \u0027meses\u0027 are intuitive in Portuguese. The use of a single-line return statement enhances readability. Only minor improvement could be a more descriptive name.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Excellent Javadoc documentation explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, potential numerical variations, and best practices. The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively for a clear conditional return.","tokens":357,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow. The variable names are in Portuguese, which might limit understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. The algorithm explanation is well documented in the initial comment.","tokens":953,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for Portuguese speakers, might hinder understanding for a broader audience. Variable names are also in Portuguese. The logic is clear, with a loop creating child nodes and assigning random names and colors. The comment about `add()` vs. `insert()` is helpful.","tokens":587,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is clear, leveraging integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is well-written and explains the method\u0027s purpose and behavior effectively in Portuguese.","tokens":366,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, has a concise Javadoc comment explaining the purpose and parameters, and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule.","tokens":362,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is well-defined by its Javadoc comment.","tokens":340,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely clear and easy to understand. It has a descriptive Javadoc comment explaining the function\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The code itself is a straightforward implementation of a simple formula, with comments explaining each step, variable names are meaningful.","tokens":354,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, explaining the purpose of the `combine` method and its parameter. The method name and variable names are clear and concise. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":354,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever modulo operation for month wrapping. The comments are clear, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, immutability, and parameter/return types. However, the use of `ENUMS` and `ordinal()` is slightly less readable without context.","tokens":382,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
