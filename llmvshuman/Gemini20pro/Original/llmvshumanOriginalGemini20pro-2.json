{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise implementation and clear Javadoc. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 aligns well with its function. The use of modulo operation is efficient. Only minor improvement could be adding a brief inline comment explaining the modulo operation\u0027s purpose.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the function\u0027s purpose, potential numerical variations, and providing a useful API note. The ternary operator makes the logic clear: return the average if there are values, otherwise return 0.","tokens":375,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays and substrings makes the logic harder to follow than necessary. The variable names are okay, but the multiple loops and string manipulations reduce the overall clarity. A more direct numerical approach would improve comprehension.","tokens":954,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but the comments in Portuguese, while helpful for native speakers, might hinder overall readability for a broader audience. Variable names are descriptive. The logic is straightforward, with a loop and conditional branching. The comment about `add()` vs `insert()` is useful.","tokens":579,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear and well-written in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior effectively.","tokens":368,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is perfectly readable. The function name, comments, and variable names are clear and concise. The logic is straightforward and easy to understand, implementing the leap year rule correctly.","tokens":361,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is also well-documented.","tokens":338,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle. The comments are clear, concise, and written in Portuguese, matching the prompt\u0027s context. The variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":345,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented in Portuguese, with clear Javadoc explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 is intuitive, and the logic is straightforward, using standard mathematical operations. Variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":359,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear algorithm. The comments are well-written and in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior with edge cases, and immutability. However, the variable name \u0027amount\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the use of ENUMS array requires some context.","tokens":387,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
