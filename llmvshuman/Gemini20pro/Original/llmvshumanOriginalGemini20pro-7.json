{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its concise and clear logic. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and parameter \u0027meses\u0027 are intuitive in Portuguese. The use of modulo operator is efficient. A minor improvement could be adding a brief comment explaining the modulo operation\u0027s purpose.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very clear and concise. The Javadoc is well-written, explaining the function\u0027s purpose, behavior, and potential numerical considerations. The use of a ternary operator makes the logic straightforward: return the average if there are values, otherwise return 0.0d.","tokens":376,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be more readable. The use of String arrays for numeric calculations and multiple loops makes it harder to follow. The logic, although explained in the comments, is a bit convoluted due to the string manipulations.","tokens":947,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively readable, with clear variable names in Portuguese. The logic is straightforward, creating child nodes with random names. However, the comment warning against using \u0027add()\u0027 is slightly confusing and could be improved with a more explicit explanation. The use of modulo operator for color is simple and effective.","tokens":580,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The logic is straightforward, using integer division to determine the start of the quarter. The Javadoc is clear, explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior with examples. Only minor improvement could be the ENUMS name.","tokens":373,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is perfectly readable. The function name, comments and variable names are clear, using Portuguese language. The logic is straightforward and well-commented, explaining the leap year rule. It uses a simple if/else statement for the return.","tokens":374,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names, has comments explaining the formula and constants, and follows a simple, straightforward calculation. The function\u0027s purpose is also clearly stated in the Javadoc.","tokens":341,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle. The comments are clear, concise, and written in Portuguese, matching the prompt\u0027s context. The variable names are also meaningful.","tokens":345,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose and parameters. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 is intuitive, and variable names are descriptive (\u0027count\u0027, \u0027simpleSum\u0027, \u0027min\u0027, \u0027max\u0027). The logic is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":364,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever modulo operation for month wrapping. However, the reliance on `ENUMS` and `ordinal()` without context slightly reduces readability. The Javadoc is well-written and in Portuguese, which is consistent.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
