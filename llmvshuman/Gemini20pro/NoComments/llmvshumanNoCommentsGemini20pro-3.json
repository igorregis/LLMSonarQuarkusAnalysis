{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the core logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (sum) with a negative value. The modulo operation\u0027s purpose isn\u0027t immediately obvious without context, and using single-letter variable is not descriptive.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to prevent division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names like \u0027novoNo\u0027, \u0027fonte\u0027, and \u0027dados\u0027 could be more descriptive in English. The logic is clear, using a loop and conditional statements to create and insert nodes, the use of constants improves readability.","tokens":476,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the magic number \u00273\u0027 slightly reduces readability, external context is needed.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is in Portuguese, which might be a minor issue for non-Portuguese speakers, but the logic is self-explanatory.","tokens":293,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (`calcularAreaCirculo`, `raio`, `PI`, `area`) and follows a straightforward calculation. A minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":263,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and self-explanatory. It uses descriptive variable names (base, altura, area) and a straightforward formula. The function name clearly indicates its purpose. It\u0027s highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names (e.g., sumWithCompensation, Math.min, Math.max). It\u0027s easy to understand that this method combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object. Loses 1 point due the lack of javadocs.","tokens":309,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding \u0027ENUMS\u0027 requires external context, slightly reducing readability. Overall, it\u0027s well-structured and easy to follow the logic.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
