{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the core logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (sum) with a negative value. The modulo operation\u0027s purpose isn\u0027t immediately obvious without context, and using domain specific terms could improve it.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to avoid division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names like \u0027novoNo\u0027, \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and the use of a constant \u0027NOMES\u0027 without context slightly reduce readability. The logic is straightforward, involving a loop and conditional assignments, making it easy to understand the code\u0027s purpose.","tokens":482,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The method name is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, it relies on an external ENUMS array and implicit ordinal() behavior, slightly reducing readability for those unfamiliar with the full context.","tokens":246,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear naming (\u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 clearly indicates a leap year check) and the logic, while slightly complex, is directly related to the well-known leap year rule. It could be 10 if it was simplified to a single return statement.","tokens":302,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (\u0027raio\u0027, \u0027area\u0027, \u0027PI\u0027) and a straightforward formula. Only minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle using a clear and well-known formula. The function and variable names are self-explanatory, even for someone not fluent in Portuguese.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names (e.g., `sumWithCompensation`, `combine`). It operates on a well-known class (`DoubleSummaryStatistics`). Minor improvements could be adding comments, but it\u0027s largely self-documenting due to its simplicity and standard operations.","tokens":311,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 context and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method is crucial, slightly reducing immediate readability without full class definition.","tokens":265,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
