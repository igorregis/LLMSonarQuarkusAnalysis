{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 suggests subtraction, but the logic involves a modulo operation and a call to \u0027soma\u0027 which likely adds. This creates confusion. Using a negative modulo might also be unexpected. Single-letter variable names reduce readability.","tokens":247,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to avoid division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively readable, with clear variable names in Portuguese. The logic is straightforward, but the conditional checks and alternating data creation could be slightly refactored for better clarity. The use of constants enhances readability.","tokens":465,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the magic number \u00273\u0027 slightly reduces readability for those unfamiliar with the enum\u0027s structure.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is understandable, although \u0027year\u0027 would be universally clear. The conditional logic is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":291,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (\u0027raio\u0027, \u0027area\u0027, \u0027PI\u0027) and follows a straightforward calculation. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for PI is good practice. A minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":269,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It uses descriptive variable names and directly implements the formula for the area of an isosceles triangle.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names. It\u0027s easy to understand the purpose of the `combine` method, which is merging data from another `DoubleSummaryStatistics` object. The use of helper methods like `sumWithCompensation` suggests handling numeric precision, which, while slightly increasing complexity, is a good practice.","tokens":318,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding requires familiarity with the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method, slightly reducing immediate readability without context.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
