{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the core logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (add) with a negative value. The modulo operation is applied only to \u0027meses\u0027 and not the overall calculation, which might lead to unexpected results. Using a more descriptive variable name instead of \u0027meses\u0027 could improve the readability.","tokens":276,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to prevent division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names in Portuguese reduce readability for a broader audience. The logic is straightforward, involving a loop and conditional assignments. Use of constants improves it, but \u0027NOMES\u0027 and methods like \u0027canDisplayUpTo\u0027 are not defined.","tokens":478,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the magic number \u00273\u0027 slightly reduces readability for those unfamiliar with the enum\u0027s structure.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable names are meaningful, although in Portuguese. The conditional statement is straightforward and easy to follow. Only lacks JavaDoc.","tokens":288,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (`calcularAreaCirculo`, `raio`, `PI`, `area`), a simple formula, and straightforward logic. Only minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of an isosceles triangle using a clear and straightforward formula. The variable names are descriptive, and the function is concise.","tokens":251,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names. It\u0027s easy to understand the purpose of the `combine` method, which is to merge statistics from another object. The use of helper methods like `sumWithCompensation` enhances readability, although their internal logic is not shown.","tokens":308,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding requires familiarity with the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method, slightly reducing immediate readability.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
