{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 suggests subtraction, but the logic involves a modulo operation and a call to \u0027soma\u0027 with a negative value, which is confusing. The single-letter variable name is not descriptive. Using a more descriptive parameter name like \u0027numberOfMonths\u0027 would improve readability.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to prevent division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for alternating multiplication and summing digits could be simplified. Variable names are not intuitive (e.g., \u0027n\u0027, \u0027soma\u0027).","tokens":531,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names like \u0027novoNo\u0027, \u0027fonte\u0027, and \u0027dados\u0027 could be more descriptive in English. The logic within the loop is clear, involving random name selection and alternating data creation. The use of constants like \u0027CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 improves readability.","tokens":490,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the magic number \u00273\u0027 slightly reduces readability. Understanding requires knowing the enum structure.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear naming (\u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 clearly indicates a leap year check) and the logic is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rule. A slight improvement could be using \u0027return\u0027 directly.","tokens":290,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names (`calcularAreaCirculo`, `raio`, `PI`, `area`), follows standard Java conventions, and the calculation is straightforward.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It uses descriptive variable names and directly implements the formula for the area of an isosceles triangle.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names. The methods `sumWithCompensation` and Math operations are standard and easily understood. It\u0027s straightforward to grasp the function\u0027s purpose: combining statistics from another object.","tokens":296,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding requires familiarity with the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method, slightly reducing immediate comprehension without context.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
