{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the core logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (sum) with a negative value. The modulo operation\u0027s purpose isn\u0027t immediately obvious without context, and single-letter variable names reduce readability.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to prevent division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses around the division.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for alternating multiplication and summing digits could be simplified. Variable names are not intuitive (e.g., \u0027n\u0027, \u0027soma\u0027).","tokens":531,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names like \u0027novoNo\u0027 and the use of a magic number (DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO) slightly reduce readability. The logic is straightforward, making it easy to follow the flow.","tokens":478,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on ordinal() and a magic number (3) slightly reduces readability. Using a constant instead of 3 would improve it.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is understandable, although \u0027year\u0027 would be universally clear. The conditional structure is straightforward.","tokens":287,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (`raio`, `area`, `PI`) and a straightforward formula. The use of `final` for `PI` is good practice. A minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":270,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle using a clear and well-known formula. The function and variable names are self-explanatory, even for someone not fluent in Portuguese.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names (combine, sumWithCompensation). It operates on a well-known class (DoubleSummaryStatistics). The logic is straightforward: combining statistics from another object. Only minor domain knowledge is required.","tokens":299,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding \u0027ENUMS\u0027 requires external context, slightly reducing readability. Overall, it\u0027s well-structured and easy to follow with some domain knowledge.","tokens":271,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
