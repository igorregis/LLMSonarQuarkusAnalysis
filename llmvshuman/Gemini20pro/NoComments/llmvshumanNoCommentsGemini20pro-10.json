{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 suggests subtraction, but the logic involves a modulo operation and a call to \u0027soma\u0027 with a negative value, which is confusing. The use of \u0027meses\u0027 (months in Portuguese) as a parameter name, while understandable, might not be ideal for broader codebases. Overall, the code\u0027s intent is not immediately clear.","tokens":272,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to avoid division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable as is.","tokens":275,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to multiple loops, string manipulations, and unclear variable names. The logic for calculating the DV is convoluted and not immediately obvious, impacting readability.","tokens":512,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names in Portuguese might hinder comprehension for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, involving a loop and conditional assignments, using meaningful names like \u0027contador\u0027 and \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027.","tokens":469,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the magic number \u00273\u0027 slightly reduces readability for those unfamiliar with the enum\u0027s structure.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is in Portuguese, which might slightly reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers, but the logic is standard.","tokens":290,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (`calcularAreaCirculo`, `raio`, `PI`, `area`) and follows a straightforward calculation. The use of `final` for `PI` is good practice. Only minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":277,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and self-explanatory. It uses clear variable names (\u0027base\u0027, \u0027altura\u0027, \u0027area\u0027) and directly implements the formula for the area of a triangle. The function name is also descriptive in Portuguese.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names. It\u0027s easy to understand the purpose of the `combine` method, which is to merge statistics from another `DoubleSummaryStatistics` object. The use of helper methods is implicit, but the operations are straightforward.","tokens":305,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding requires familiarity with the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method, slightly reducing immediate comprehension without context.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
