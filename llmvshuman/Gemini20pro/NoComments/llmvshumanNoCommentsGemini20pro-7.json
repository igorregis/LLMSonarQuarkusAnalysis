{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the core logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (add) with a negative value. The modulo operation\u0027s purpose isn\u0027t immediately obvious without context, and single-letter variable names reduce readability.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to avoid division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for extra clarity, but it\u0027s very readable.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for alternating multiplication and summing digits could be simplified. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":521,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names in Portuguese might hinder understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, involving a loop and conditional assignments, with a clear purpose of populating child nodes with data.","tokens":468,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is self-explanatory (first month of the quarter). Using \u0027ordinal() / 3 * 3\u0027 is clever for finding the start of the quarter. However, relying on enum ordinal is generally discouraged.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is in Portuguese, which might be a minor issue for non-Portuguese speakers, but the logic is self-explanatory.","tokens":293,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable. It uses clear variable names (\u0027raio\u0027, \u0027area\u0027, \u0027PI\u0027), a simple formula, and a straightforward calculation. The function does exactly one thing and is very easy to understand.","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and self-explanatory. It uses descriptive variable names and directly implements the formula for the area of a triangle. It\u0027s perfectly readable.","tokens":246,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names (count, simpleSum, min, max). The methods (sumWithCompensation, Math.min, Math.max) are standard and easily understood. It\u0027s a straightforward implementation of combining statistics.","tokens":302,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding requires familiarity with the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method, slightly reducing immediate comprehension without context.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
