{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 (subtract) suggests subtraction, but the internal logic uses \u0027soma\u0027 (sum) with a negative value. The modulo operation is only applied to \u0027meses\u0027, making the logic unclear without context of the \u0027soma\u0027 method and the overall class purpose. It\u0027s concise but cryptic.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to avoid division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses around the division.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names in Portuguese reduce readability for a broader audience. Uses a constant (CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO) which is good. The logic for selecting fonts and colors is clear, and the use of a helper class (DadosAmostra) is acceptable.","tokens":488,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The method name is descriptive (in Portuguese). \u0027ENUMS\u0027 could be more descriptive, but it\u0027s understandable in context. Overall, good readability.","tokens":241,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The conditional statement is straightforward, directly implementing the leap year rules. Only minor improvement could be removing the else statement.","tokens":286,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names (`calcularAreaCirculo`, `raio`, `PI`, `area`), a simple formula, and straightforward logic. The constant PI is explicitly defined. Only minor improvement could be using `Math.PI`.","tokens":272,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It uses descriptive variable names and directly implements the formula for the area of an isosceles triangle.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names. It\u0027s easy to understand the purpose of the `combine` method, which is to merge statistics from another object. The use of helper methods like `sumWithCompensation` suggests a focus on numerical stability, enhancing the code\u0027s quality, although it requires a bit of domain knowledge.","tokens":320,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding \u0027ENUMS\u0027 requires external context, slightly reducing readability.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
