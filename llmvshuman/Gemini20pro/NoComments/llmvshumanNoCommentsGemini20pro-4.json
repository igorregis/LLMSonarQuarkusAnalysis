{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027 are not standard English names (they are Portuguese), which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic of subtracting by adding a modulo is not immediately obvious, and there\u0027s no context or comments to explain the purpose.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. It\u0027s easy to understand that it calculates the average (media) by dividing the sum by the count, returning 0 if the count is 0 to prevent division by zero. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses around the division.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is unnecessarily complex. It uses String arrays and repeated conversions between String and Integer, making it hard to follow. The logic for weighting digits and summing them is convoluted. The variable names are not very descriptive.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand, with clear variable names in Portuguese. The logic is straightforward, but the conditional `fontes \u003d\u003d null || fontes[indiceAleatorio].canDisplayUpTo(stringExibicao) !\u003d -1` and the alternating color logic could be slightly refactored for better clarity.","tokens":486,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear calculation. The name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive (in Portuguese). However, reliance on ordinal() and a magic number (3) slightly reduces readability. Understanding requires knowing the enum structure.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable. It uses clear and concise logic to determine if a year is a leap year. The variable name \u0027ano\u0027 is understandable, although \u0027year\u0027 would be universally clear. The conditional expression is well-structured.","tokens":289,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear function name, uses descriptive variable names, and straightforward calculation. Loses a point because PI could be replaced with Math.PI for better accuracy and standard practice.","tokens":251,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a triangle using a clear and well-known formula. The function and variable names are self-explanatory, even for someone not fluent in Portuguese.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear method names. It\u0027s easy to understand the purpose of the `combine` method, which is to merge statistics from another object. The use of helper methods like `sumWithCompensation` enhances readability, although their internal implementation is not shown.","tokens":308,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear formula for month calculation. The modulo operation ensures correct wrapping. However, understanding the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 context and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method is crucial, slightly reducing readability without that external information.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
