{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing two concepts (Brocolis and Espinafre/Jaca). Using a ternary operator in this case only makes the code harder to read, an if/else statement would improve readability. A more descriptive name would improve a lot.","tokens":269,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-character variable names (s, d, p, i, n), making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations. The operations within the loops are not immediately clear, and the use of a String array to store intermediate integer results is inefficient.","tokens":527,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English (Portuguese) variable and method names, making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The logic itself is obscured by the lack of meaningful identifiers, even for Portuguese speakers, the names are domain unrelated.","tokens":496,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the lack of context and meaningful identifiers. It\u0027s unclear what this method is intended to do.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand. It checks if a number is a leap year. The logic is clear, but it could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, improving readability slightly.","tokens":277,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027a\u0027 for area, \u0027P\u0027 for Pi).  A minor improvement could be using `Math.PI` instead of a constant.","tokens":267,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks context. Variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) are uninformative, hindering understanding. It calculates an area (likely a triangle\u0027s), but without comments or meaningful names, it\u0027s unclear. A better naming like base, height and area will improve the score.","tokens":269,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (Portuguese food items), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or logic without external context. It severely hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":306,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 severely hinder understanding. The calculation, while simple, is obscured by the lack of context. Using meaningful names and perhaps a comment explaining the modulo operation\u0027s purpose would drastically improve readability.","tokens":289,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
