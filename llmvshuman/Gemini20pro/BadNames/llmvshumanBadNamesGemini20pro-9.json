{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose of the method and variables. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the poor naming, hindering readability.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing English (get) with Portuguese words like \u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, and \u0027Jaca\u0027, making it hard to understand for non-Portuguese speakers. The ternary operator, while concise, adds a bit of complexity to the single-line logic.","tokens":275,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, and \u0027d\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations, and lacks comments to explain the algorithm, hindering readability.","tokens":519,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The variable names are also nonsensical (food items), further hindering comprehension. The logic, even with translation, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":499,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is extremely difficult to understand due to the use of Portuguese names for methods and variables without any context. \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not standard terms, making it impossible to determine the code\u0027s purpose without external information.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand. It checks if a number is a leap year. The logic is clear, but it could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, improving readability.","tokens":276,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Using a constant \u0027P\u0027 for Pi is good. Variable names (\u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) could be slightly more descriptive (\u0027area\u0027, \u0027radius\u0027), but the context makes their purpose clear, minor impact.","tokens":269,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, though.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (food items in Portuguese), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or functionality without external context. It severely hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":307,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable and method names are obfuscated and use a mix of Portuguese and English words (\u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027). The logic, while simple, is obscured by these names, making it hard to understand the purpose without careful examination.","tokens":286,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
