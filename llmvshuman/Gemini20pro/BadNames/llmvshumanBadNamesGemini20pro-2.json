{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing English (get) with Portuguese words like \u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, and \u0027Jaca\u0027, making it hard to understand for non-Portuguese speakers. The ternary operator, while concise, adds to the cognitive load without context.","tokens":271,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-character variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, and \u0027d\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is complex with multiple loops and string manipulations, and the algorithm\u0027s intent is unclear without context or comments.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The variable names are also nonsensical (food-related), further hindering comprehension. The logic, even with translation, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":500,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. Using an ordinal in a calculation and returning an element from an array without context further reduces readability.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand, it implements a leap year check. It could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression, instead of using an if/else statement, enhancing conciseness.","tokens":279,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027P\u0027 for PI, \u0027a\u0027 for area).  \u0027P\u0027 is final, which is good. Could be 10 if it had a javadoc comment.","tokens":274,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks context. Variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) are uninformative, hindering understanding. It calculates something, likely the area of a triangle, but this isn\u0027t explicitly stated. A comment and descriptive names would improve readability.","tokens":260,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names (in Portuguese), making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose and logic without external context. It relies on implicit knowledge of what these names represent.","tokens":305,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it very hard to understand the purpose. It seems to perform a calculation related to months, but the logic is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":283,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
