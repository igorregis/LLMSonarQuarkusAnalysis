{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose of the method and variables. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the poor naming, hindering readability.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing two concepts (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca), making it hard to understand the business logic. Using a ternary operator adds a bit more complexity. A more descriptive naming convention in English would improve readability.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Cryptic variable names (dv, p, s, d), unclear logic without context, multiple loops with nested operations, and string manipulations make it hard to understand. The algorithm\u0027s purpose is not immediately obvious.","tokens":512,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English, seemingly nonsensical variable names (e.g., \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027), making it extremely difficult to understand the code\u0027s purpose and logic without external context. The use of food names is highly unconventional and greatly reduces readability.","tokens":508,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it very hard to understand the purpose. It uses a calculation based on \u0027ordinal()\u0027, which, without context, is unclear. The division and multiplication by 3 suggest a grouping, but the logic is obscure.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand, it implements a leap year check. It could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression, instead of using an if/else statement, for conciseness, but it is readable.","tokens":284,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a circle. Using a constant \u0027P\u0027 for Pi improves readability. Minor improvement could be naming \u0027a\u0027 to \u0027area\u0027.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027r\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027result\u0027, \u0027base\u0027, and \u0027height\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, though.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names (in Portuguese), making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose and logic without context. It relies on external class members, further hindering comprehension.","tokens":304,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 obscure the code\u0027s purpose. Meaningless variable names hinder understanding. Using modulo operator twice with an offset makes logic hard to follow without context.","tokens":281,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
