{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming. It lacks context.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, making it hard for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The ternary operator, while concise, could be more readable as an if-else statement. The meaning of \u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, and \u0027Jaca\u0027 is unclear without context.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-letter variable names like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations. The operations within the loops are not immediately clear, and the use of ternary operator adds to the complexity. Overall, it lacks clarity and requires significant effort to decipher.","tokens":534,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The logic is obscured by the lack of meaningful identifiers, and the purpose of the code is unclear.","tokens":490,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is extremely difficult to understand due to the use of Portuguese names for methods and variables without any context. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the lack of meaningful identifiers, making comprehension very challenging.","tokens":241,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand. It checks if a number is a leap year. The logic is clear, but it could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, thus improving readability.","tokens":277,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027a\u0027 for area, \u0027P\u0027 for Pi).  \u0027P\u0027 could be Math.PI, but it\u0027s still very understandable. The final keyword is a good practice.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027r\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, representing a basic formula (likely area of a triangle).","tokens":264,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (food items in Portuguese), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or logic without further context. It severely hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":307,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are obfuscated and use a mix of Portuguese and English words (\u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, \u0027menta\u0027), making the code hard to understand. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the naming.","tokens":280,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
