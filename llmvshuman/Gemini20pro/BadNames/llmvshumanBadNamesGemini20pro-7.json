{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing vegetables (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca). It uses a ternary operator, which could be simplified. Using domain unrelated names makes the code hard to understand without context.","tokens":261,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-character variable names like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations. The use of a String array to store integer values is also not intuitive. Overall, it lacks clarity and readability.","tokens":524,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The variable names are also nonsensical (food names), hindering comprehension even for Portuguese speakers. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the naming.","tokens":500,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The calculation within the method is also unclear without context of \u0027ordinal()\u0027.","tokens":240,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand. It checks if a number is a leap year. The logic is clear, but it could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, improving readability slightly.","tokens":277,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027a\u0027 for area, \u0027P\u0027 for Pi).  \u0027P\u0027 could be improved by using Math.PI. The calculation is simple and direct.","tokens":270,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, representing a basic formula.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (food items in Portuguese), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or logic without additional context. Method and variable should have comprehensive names.","tokens":307,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 obscure the code\u0027s purpose. Using meaningful names is crucial for readability. The calculation logic, while simple, is hard to understand without context.","tokens":281,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
