{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing English (get) with Portuguese words like \u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, and \u0027Jaca\u0027. This significantly hinders readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Using a ternary operator adds a bit of complexity, but the main issue is the inconsistent naming convention.","tokens":275,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable names (\u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027) are cryptic. The logic is convoluted with multiple loops and string manipulations, making it hard to understand the purpose. The use of a String array to store integer values is also not efficient.","tokens":514,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it hard for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. Variable names like \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027inhame\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic within the loop is also obscured by these names and unclear operations.","tokens":504,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The calculation logic is also unclear without context. It\u0027s difficult to grasp the intent without further information.","tokens":246,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand. It checks if a number is a leap year. The logic is clear, but it could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, improving readability slightly.","tokens":277,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027a\u0027 for area, \u0027P\u0027 for Pi).  \u0027P\u0027 could be Math.PI, but it\u0027s still very understandable. The final keyword is a good practice.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, representing a basic formula.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (Portuguese food names), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or logic without external context. Method and variable semantics are crucial.","tokens":305,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are obfuscated and do not convey meaning (nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). Method name \u0027menta\u0027 is also unclear. The logic, while simple, is hard to understand due to the naming.","tokens":275,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
