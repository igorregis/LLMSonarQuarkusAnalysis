{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing two concepts (\u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, \u0027Jaca\u0027). Using a ternary operator for a simple division check adds unnecessary complexity. A more descriptive English naming convention would improve readability.","tokens":261,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-character variable names, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations. It lacks comments explaining the algorithm, and the array `d` has an unused element at index 0. Overall, it\u0027s difficult to grasp.","tokens":523,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English (Portuguese) variable and method names, making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The logic itself is obscured by the lack of meaningful identifiers, even for Portuguese speakers, the names are not contextual.","tokens":496,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The calculation logic is also unclear without context of \u0027ordinal()\u0027.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a well-known formula. The logic is straightforward (leap year check). Variable names are short but acceptable in this context. Could be simplified to return the condition directly, but it\u0027s readable as is.","tokens":286,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward. It calculates the area of a circle. Uses clear variable names (\u0027r\u0027 for radius, \u0027P\u0027 for PI, \u0027a\u0027 for area).  \u0027P\u0027 is final, which is good practice. Could be 10 if PI was used from Math.PI","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027a\u0027, \u0027b\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, though.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (Portuguese food names), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or functionality without external context. It severely hinders readability and maintainability.","tokens":306,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Cryptic names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 obscure the code\u0027s purpose. Using modulo operator twice with magic numbers (12) further reduces readability. Meaningless variable names hinder understanding the logic\u0027s intent.","tokens":286,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
