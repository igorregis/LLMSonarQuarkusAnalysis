{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose. The logic, a modulo operation followed by a negation and a method call, is obscured by the poor naming. It lacks context.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, mixing vegetables (Brocolis, Espinafre) and fruit (Jaca). This makes it hard to understand the code\u0027s purpose for non-Portuguese speakers and even for them, the context is confusing. Using a ternary operator adds a bit of complexity.","tokens":276,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses single-character variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, and \u0027d\u0027, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is convoluted, involving multiple loops and string manipulations with unclear intent. The use of arrays and substrings adds complexity.","tokens":520,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The logic is obscured by the lack of context and meaningful names, even for Portuguese speakers, the names are not representative.","tokens":494,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is extremely difficult to understand due to the use of Portuguese names for methods and variables without any context. \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not standard terms, making it impossible to determine the code\u0027s purpose without external information.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It implements a leap year check. Could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression, but it\u0027s already quite readable.","tokens":272,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a circle. Using a constant \u0027P\u0027 for Pi improves readability. Minor improvement could be naming \u0027a\u0027 to \u0027area\u0027.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple but uses single-letter variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) which reduces readability. More descriptive names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would improve understanding. The calculation is straightforward, representing a basic formula.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names (Portuguese words for vegetables and spices), making it extremely difficult to understand the code\u0027s purpose and logic without additional context. The lack of comments makes the comprehension even worst.","tokens":311,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable names are obfuscated and use a mix of Portuguese and English words (\u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, \u0027menta\u0027). The logic, while simple, is obscured by poor naming, making it hard to understand the purpose without careful examination.","tokens":284,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
