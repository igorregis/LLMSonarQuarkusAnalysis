{"score":"1","reasoning":"The method and variable names (\u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, \u0027menta\u0027) are meaningless, making the code\u0027s purpose impossible to understand without further context. The logic is also obscured by the lack of clarity.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are in Portuguese, making it hard for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The ternary operator, while concise, could be expanded for better readability. Using domain-specific terms without context further reduces comprehension.","tokens":259,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable names (\u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027) are cryptic. The logic is convoluted with multiple loops and string manipulations, making it hard to understand the purpose without external context. The use of arrays and substrings adds to the complexity.","tokens":519,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-English variable names (Portuguese), making it extremely difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The variable names are also nonsensical (food items), hindering comprehension even for Portuguese speakers. The logic, although simple, is obscured by the naming.","tokens":500,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, and \u0027ordinal\u0027, making it very hard to understand the purpose. It performs a calculation that seems related to quarters of a year, but without context, it\u0027s obscure.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand, it implements a leap year check. It could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression, instead of using an if/else statement, but it is readable.","tokens":279,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a circle. Using a constant \u0027P\u0027 for Pi is good. Variable names (\u0027a\u0027 for area, \u0027r\u0027 for radius) are concise but clear in this context. Could be a 10 if it had a javadoc comment.","tokens":279,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks context. Variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027) are uninformative, making it hard to understand the purpose without external documentation. A more descriptive naming (e.g., base, height, area) would significantly improve readability.","tokens":260,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely unrelated and nonsensical variable and method names (food items in Portuguese), making it impossible to understand the code\u0027s purpose or logic without further context. Method and variable semantics are crucial.","tokens":306,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Variable and method names are confusing and semantically meaningless (\u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027). The calculation logic, while simple, is obscured by the poor naming. Using modulo operator twice is not intuitive. \u0027ordinal()\u0027 likely refers to an enum, but it\u0027s unclear without context.","tokens":296,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
