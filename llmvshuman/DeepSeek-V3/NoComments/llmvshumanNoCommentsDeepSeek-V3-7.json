{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear method name and purpose. However, the lack of context for the soma method and missing comments slightly reduce comprehension.","tokens":214,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. Only minor improvements could be made for even better clarity.","tokens":227,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027n\u0027 and \u0027i\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic for calculating the check digit is complex and could be simplified. Comments or better structure would improve readability.","tokens":478,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduce comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":449,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever calculation to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":229,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The logic for determining a leap year is clear and concise. The method name and variable are appropriately named, enhancing readability.","tokens":255,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could make it perfect.","tokens":239,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward calculation. It adheres to Java conventions and is easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined, which slightly reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":263,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo arithmetic effectively. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":235,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
