{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a method call effectively. However, the lack of comments and context for the soma method reduces readability. The modulo operation is clear but could benefit from more explanation.","tokens":220,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively, making it easy to read and understand. The method name and logic are clear, but could benefit from a brief comment explaining the purpose.","tokens":234,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027num\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic for calculating the check digit is complex and could be simplified. Proper comments and better variable naming would improve readability.","tokens":480,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduce comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever calculation to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":229,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The method name is clear, and the logic for determining a leap year is straightforward and correctly implemented.","tokens":251,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI for precision.","tokens":237,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward calculation. It adheres to Java conventions and is easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined here, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":262,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo operations effectively. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the class structure.","tokens":235,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
