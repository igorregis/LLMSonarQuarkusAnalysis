{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a method call effectively. However, the lack of comments and context for the soma method reduces readability. Variable naming is clear but could be more descriptive.","tokens":218,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. The use of final indicates immutability, adding to code safety.","tokens":230,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027num\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic is complex and could be simplified. Proper comments and better naming would improve readability.","tokens":474,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduce comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever calculation to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":229,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The method name is clear, and the logic for determining a leap year is straightforward and correctly implemented.","tokens":251,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could make it perfect.","tokens":239,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward calculation. It adheres to Java conventions and is easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with its purpose.","tokens":269,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo arithmetic effectively. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the class structure.","tokens":235,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
