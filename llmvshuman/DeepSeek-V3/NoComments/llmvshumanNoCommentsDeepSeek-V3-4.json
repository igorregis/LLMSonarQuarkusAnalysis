{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a method call effectively. However, the lack of comments and context for the soma method reduces readability. Variable naming is clear but could be more descriptive.","tokens":218,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. The use of final and double is appropriate. Only minor improvement could be adding comments for context.","tokens":235,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names are not descriptive, and the logic is hard to follow due to nested loops and conditions. Improved readability with better naming and comments would help.","tokens":472,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduces readability. The logic is clear but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear mathematical approach to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The logic for determining a leap year is clear and concise. The method name and variable are appropriately named in Portuguese, aiding readability for native speakers.","tokens":260,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":238,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, proper parameter naming, and straightforward logic. It effectively calculates the area of an isosceles triangle.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined, which slightly reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":257,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo operations effectively. However, the use of magic numbers (12) and lack of comments slightly reduce readability. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is clear but could be more descriptive.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
