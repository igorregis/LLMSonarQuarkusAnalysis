{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable, with a clear method name and purpose. However, the use of modulo operation without explanation might confuse some readers about its necessity.","tokens":214,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. The use of final indicates immutability, adding to code safety.","tokens":230,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027num\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic is complex and could be simplified with better comments or refactoring.","tokens":472,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduces comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear mathematical approach to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The method name is clear, and the logic for determining a leap year is straightforward and correctly implemented.","tokens":251,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":238,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward calculation. It adheres to Java conventions and is easy to understand.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined, which slightly reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":257,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo operations effectively. However, the use of magic numbers (12) and lack of comments reduces readability. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is clear, but the logic could be better explained.","tokens":247,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
