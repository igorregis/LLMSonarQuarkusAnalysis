{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a method call effectively. However, the lack of comments and context for the soma method reduces readability. The modulo operation is clear but could benefit from more descriptive variable names.","tokens":222,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. The use of final and double precision is appropriate.","tokens":226,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027num\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic is complex and could be simplified with better structure and comments.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduce comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from better encapsulation and explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever calculation to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context may confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":229,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The logic for determining a leap year is clear and concise. The use of parentheses enhances readability. Only minor improvements could be made, such as simplifying the return statement.","tokens":264,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":238,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, proper parameter naming, and straightforward logic. The calculation is simple and easy to understand.","tokens":225,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined, which slightly reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":257,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo operations effectively. However, the use of magic numbers (12) and lack of comments reduces readability. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is also vague.","tokens":240,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
