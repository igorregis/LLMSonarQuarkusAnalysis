{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a method call effectively. However, the lack of comments and context for the soma method reduces readability. Variable naming is clear but could be more descriptive.","tokens":218,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity. Method names are descriptive, enhancing readability. The use of final and double precision is appropriate.","tokens":226,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names like \u0027num\u0027 and \u0027n\u0027 are not descriptive. The logic for calculating the check digit is complex and could be simplified. Proper comments or method extraction would improve readability.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is readable with clear variable names and structure. However, the use of magic numbers and lack of comments slightly reduces comprehension. The logic is straightforward but could benefit from more context or explanation.","tokens":453,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear mathematical approach to determine the first month of a quarter. However, the use of ENUMS and ordinal() without context might confuse readers unfamiliar with the enum structure.","tokens":230,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The method name is clear, and the logic for determining a leap year is concise and correctly implemented. The use of parentheses enhances readability.","tokens":258,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could make it perfect.","tokens":239,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name, meaningful variable names, and a straightforward calculation. It follows good practices and is easy to understand.","tokens":227,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. However, the method \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 is not defined in the snippet, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":266,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo operations effectively. However, the use of magic numbers (12) and lack of comments reduces readability. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is also vague.","tokens":240,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
