{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method names and variable are not descriptive, making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is simple but obscured by poor naming.","tokens":213,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are unclear, reducing readability. A more descriptive naming convention would improve comprehension.","tokens":245,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks readability due to poor variable naming (e.g., p, s, d) and unclear logic. The nested loops and string manipulations make it harder to follow. Better naming and comments would improve comprehension.","tokens":455,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like abobora, alhoPoro, and feijaoVerde, making it hard to understand. The logic is also unclear due to poor naming and lack of comments.","tokens":472,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses array indexing effectively. However, the method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is unclear, and the logic involving \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and division by 3 could be better explained with comments or a more descriptive method name.","tokens":239,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear logic for checking leap years. The use of parentheses and logical operators is well-structured, making it easy to understand.","tokens":246,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a simple structure. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could be suggested.","tokens":232,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a simple calculation. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 could be more descriptive, but the logic is straightforward and easy to understand.","tokens":226,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like batata, salsa, and pimenta, making it hard to understand. Method names like abobora and gengibre are unclear. The logic is obfuscated due to poor naming conventions.","tokens":309,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like nozMoscada and oregano, making it hard to understand. The logic is also unclear without context, reducing readability.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
