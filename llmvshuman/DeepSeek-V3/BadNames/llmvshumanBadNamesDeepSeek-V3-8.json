{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are unclear, reducing readability. A more descriptive naming convention would improve comprehension.","tokens":245,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names are cryptic (e.g., p, s, d), making it hard to understand the purpose. The logic is complex and could benefit from comments or better structure.","tokens":452,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like abobora, alhoPoro, and feijaoVerde, making it hard to understand. The logic is also unclear due to poor naming and lack of comments.","tokens":476,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks context. Method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is unclear. Array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and its usage are not explained. Overall, it\u0027s readable but hard to understand without additional context.","tokens":235,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear logic for checking leap years. The use of parentheses and straightforward conditions makes it easy to understand.","tokens":242,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a simple structure. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could make it perfect.","tokens":233,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable names and a single-purpose function. The calculation is easy to understand, but a comment explaining the formula could improve readability further.","tokens":226,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names like gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, and berinjela, making it hard to understand the purpose and logic. The lack of comments or context further reduces readability.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
