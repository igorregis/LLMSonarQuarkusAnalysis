{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method names and variable names are not descriptive, making it hard to understand the purpose of the code. The logic is also unclear due to the lack of meaningful context.","tokens":220,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator effectively. Method names are descriptive, but the logic could be clearer with comments or more explicit variable names.","tokens":230,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names are cryptic (e.g., p, s, d), and the logic is not immediately intuitive. Proper naming and comments would improve readability.","tokens":447,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like abobora, alhoPoro, and feijaoVerde, making it hard to understand. The logic is also unclear due to poor naming and lack of comments.","tokens":476,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses array indexing effectively. However, the method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is unclear, and the logic involving \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and division by 3 could be better explained with comments or a more descriptive method name.","tokens":239,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear logic for checking leap years. The use of parentheses and straightforward conditions makes it easy to understand. Minor improvement could be direct return of the condition.","tokens":252,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a simple structure. The use of a constant for PI enhances understanding. Only minor improvements like using Math.PI could make it perfect.","tokens":233,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, with clear variable names and a single-purpose function. The calculation is easy to understand, making it highly readable.","tokens":220,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable and method names like gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, and berinjela, making it hard to understand the purpose and logic. The lack of comments or context further reduces readability.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like nozMoscada and oregano, making it hard to understand. The logic is also unclear without context, reducing readability.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
