{"score":"2","reasoning":"Nomes de metodos e variaveis como paprica alecrim e menta nao sao descritivos. A logica -(alecrim % 12) e obscura sem contexto. Dificulta a compreensao imediata do codigo.","tokens":1031,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and correctly handles division by zero using a ternary operator. However, the method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are in Portuguese and unconventional for standard Java practice, significantly impacting readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1016,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to extremely poor naming conventions for variables and methods like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and \u0027s\u0027. The logic involves complex string manipulations and integer conversions, making it hard to follow the intended algorithm, which appears to be a variation of the Luhn algorithm. The use of strings to store intermediate numeric results adds unnecessary complexity and reduces readability.","tokens":1273,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely obscure and irrelevant Portuguese food names for variables and methods, making it nearly impossible to understand its purpose or logic. This violates fundamental readability principles. There\u0027s also a potential compilation error with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() if feijaoVerde is an int.","tokens":1283,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Nomes de método e variável em português (\u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027) não são descritivos. O uso de ordinal() para indexação de array é frágil e difícil de entender. O cálculo do índice é obscuro e carece de contexto, prejudicando a legibilidade.","tokens":1004,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code correctly implements leap year logic but suffers from poor naming conventions for the parameter \u0027a\u0027 and the method \u0027isAB\u0027 which hinders immediate understanding. The if-else structure returning booleans is also verbose and can be simplified.","tokens":1054,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is extremely simple and easy to understand. The calculation for the area of a circle is clear. Using Math.PI instead of a hardcoded value would improve precision and adherence to Java best practices but it doesnt significantly impact comprehension for this snippet.","tokens":903,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name calc and parameter names a b are too generic making the code\u0027s purpose unclear. Variable r is also uninformative. While the logic is simple the lack of descriptive naming severely impacts readability and comprehension of its intent.","tokens":1006,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely unconventional and non-descriptive names for methods, variables, and parameters (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora). This makes the code virtually unreadable and impossible to comprehend without external context. It violates standard Java naming conventions.","tokens":1035,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable and method names are in Portuguese and lack clarity (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena). The logic using ordinal() and modulo arithmetic is obscure without context. Readability is very low due to non-descriptive naming conventions.","tokens":1025,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
