{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear arithmetic and named types, aiding comprehension. However method and parameter names are nonstandard and ambiguous, and absence of context for Month and menta reduces readability. Lack of comments and unconventional negative modulo handling may confuse maintainers.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses ternary for null-safe division but method and variable names are nonstandard and semantically unclear which harms readability. Repeated method calls may have side effects or performance costs. Consider caching calls, adding descriptive names and javadoc, and handling zero or negative cases explicitly.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Código funciona mas tem problemas de legibilidade: nomes de variaveis pouco descritivos, uso de array com deslocamento estranho, manipulação de strings para digitos e conversoes desnecessarias. Laços com limites confusos e possivel risco de NullPointer. Estrutura entendivel porem dificil de manter e testar.","tokens":496,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is functionally understandable but uses misleading Portuguese variable names mixed with English types and random names, reducing readability. Lack of comments, inconsistent naming, and an odd cast using feijaoVerde before initialization are confusing. Structure and logic are simple and consistent though, so comprehension is moderate.","tokens":490,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method is concise but cryptic: names in Portuguese help but tomilho and pimentaCaiena are not descriptive of purpose; use of ordinal() suggests enum context but implicit dependency reduces clarity; magic number 3 repeated should be a named constant; overall readable but needs better naming and a comment","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear, uses standard leap year logic with explicit boolean return. Readability is high but can be slightly improved by returning the condition directly and renaming method and parameter for clarity.","tokens":271,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Código curto, nomes claros e uso de constante final facilita compreensão. Poderia melhorar usando Math.PI em vez de valor hardcoded e nome de constante mais descritivo (PI). Fora isso estrutura é simples e legível.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear with meaningful names calc, a, b could be improved by descriptive parameter names and consistent ordering. Unnecessary local variable r could be inlined. Lacks JavaDoc and edge case comments but overall very readable and simple to comprehend","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method uses unclear non English identifiers and mixes languages reducing readability. Uses ambiguous DoubleSummaryStatistics type mismatch with custom fields like batata, salsa, tomate etc which is confusing. Lack of comments and inconsistent naming lowers comprehension. Structure is simple but semantic intent is unclear","tokens":314,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise and intent can be inferred: converts long to int month offset and returns element from array with wraparound. Naming uses playful nonstandard identifiers which reduces immediate clarity but logic is simple. Casting and modulo handled correctly though magic numbers and array dependency hide context.","tokens":280,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
