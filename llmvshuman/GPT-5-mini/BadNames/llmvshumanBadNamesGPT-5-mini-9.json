{"score":"7","reasoning":"Method is concise and uses clear types but naming is cryptic: paprica, alecrim, menta reduce immediate clarity. Logic is simple: returns menta of negative remainder mod 12. No comments or null handling. Readability would improve with descriptive names and explanation of Month and menta behavior.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear ternary use and consistent naming pattern, making intent easy to infer. Minor readability issues: method and variable names are nonstandard nouns and may confuse domain meaning; calling getters twice could have side effects if not pure. Otherwise simple and easy to comprehend.","tokens":270,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is functional but uses odd indexing with extra array slot and reversed loops making flow hard to follow. Heavy use of Strings for numeric ops and repetitive Integer.valueOf adds cognitive load. Variable names are terse. Logic could be clearer with ints, direct digit processing and documented intent. Overall readable but not clean or idiomatic.","tokens":492,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise but cryptic: method name tomilho and array pimentaCaiena are domain-ambiguous, ordinal() use implies enum context but not shown, no null checks, magic arithmetic ( /3 *3 ) needs comment or named constant. Readability moderate due to lack of context and descriptive names.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses clear leap year logic but method name is vague and parameter name could be clearer. Braces and structure are fine but the return could be simplified to the boolean expression. No comments and no null concerns but overall very readable.","tokens":280,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Codigo claro e conciso com nomes significativos e uso de constantes. Pequena melhoria possivel: nome mais descritivo para metodo e constante (calc -\u003e calcAreaCirculo, P -\u003e PI) e usar Math.PI para maior precisao.","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Code is concise and clear with meaningful variable names for formula components a and b could be clearer if renamed to base and height but overall simple, properly typed, and returns result directly. Minor improvement: inline return without temporary variable and add JavaDoc for intent.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method is short but uses nonstandard Portuguese variable names mixing with Java types making intent unclear. Uses public with no javadoc, side effects on fields, ambiguous parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics mismatched to custom fields, magic negation and external method abobora reduce clarity. Naming and context hamper readability.","tokens":322,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is short and logic is clear but naming is obfuscated with unrelated culinary identifiers, reducing immediate comprehension. Casting and modular arithmetic are correct but magic numbers and odd names hurt readability. A brief comment or clearer variable and array names would improve maintainability.","tokens":278,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Nomes de variaveis obfuscados e mistura de portugues/ingles dificultam leitura. Estrutura e fluxo sao simples e entendiveis, uso consistente de padroes, mas falta claridade sem comentarios e nomes significativos. Complexidade baixa porem mantenibilidade reduzida.","tokens":491,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
