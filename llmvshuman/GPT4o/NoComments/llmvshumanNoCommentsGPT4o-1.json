{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, which are understandable for Portuguese speakers. However, it lacks comments and context, making it slightly harder to grasp for those unfamiliar with the surrounding code. The use of modulo operation is clear, but the logic behind subtracting months could be better explained.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for conditional logic, which is efficient and clear for experienced developers. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 suggests it calculates an average, and the logic aligns with this. However, the readability could be slightly improved by using more descriptive method names for \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027, as their purpose isn\u0027t immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":288,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable but could be improved. Variable names like \u0027soma\u0027 and \u0027numeros\u0027 are in Portuguese, which might not be clear to non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is somewhat complex due to multiple loops and conditional operations. The use of String arrays for numeric operations is unconventional and could be optimized. Comments or more descriptive variable names would enhance understanding.","tokens":514,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally readable and follows a clear structure with meaningful variable names. The use of a loop to create and insert nodes is straightforward. However, the use of Portuguese for variable names and comments may reduce readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Additionally, the logic for selecting the font and color is simple but could be more concise. Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to follow.","tokens":477,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a straightforward calculation to determine the first month of the quarter. However, it assumes the existence of an ENUMS array and that the ordinal() method is correctly implemented, which might not be clear to someone unfamiliar with the context. The use of magic numbers (3) could be improved by defining them as constants for better readability.","tokens":267,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, implementing a well-known algorithm to determine leap years. The use of logical operators is straightforward, and the method name is descriptive. However, the \u0027else\u0027 block is unnecessary since the \u0027if\u0027 block already returns a boolean value. Removing the \u0027else\u0027 would slightly improve readability.","tokens":291,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with a well-named method \u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 that indicates its purpose. The use of a constant for PI improves readability and maintainability. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. The only minor improvement could be using Java\u0027s Math.PI for better precision, but this does not significantly impact readability.","tokens":280,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and clearly named, making it easy to understand. The method name \u0027calcularAreaTrianguloIsosceles\u0027 accurately describes its purpose, and the variable \u0027area\u0027 is appropriately named. The formula for calculating the area of an isosceles triangle is correctly implemented. The only minor improvement could be adding comments for educational purposes, but it\u0027s not necessary for comprehension.","tokens":286,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. It performs a combination of statistics by updating count, sum, min, and max values. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined here, which could affect comprehension if the reader is unfamiliar with its implementation. Overall, the logic is straightforward, but the missing context slightly reduces readability.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear logic to calculate the new month by adding a given number of months to the current month. The use of modulo operation ensures the result wraps around correctly. However, the use of \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 assumes familiarity with the context, which might not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the surrounding code. Adding comments or more descriptive variable names could improve readability.","tokens":292,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
