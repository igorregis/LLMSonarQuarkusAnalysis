{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, which suggest subtraction and addition operations. However, the lack of comments and context about the \u0027Month\u0027 class and \u0027soma\u0027 method reduces readability. The use of modulo operation is clear, but without understanding the \u0027soma\u0027 method, it\u0027s hard to fully grasp the logic. Adding comments or documentation would improve comprehension.","tokens":275,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for conditional logic, which is efficient and clear for experienced developers. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 suggests it calculates an average, and the logic aligns with this. However, the readability could be slightly improved by using more descriptive method names for \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027, as their purpose isn\u0027t immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":288,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable but could be improved. Variable names like \u0027soma\u0027 and \u0027numeros\u0027 are in Portuguese, which might not be clear to non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is somewhat complex due to multiple loops and conditional operations. The use of String arrays for numeric operations is unconventional and could be optimized. Comments or more descriptive variable names would enhance understanding.","tokens":514,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. The logic for selecting a font and color based on the index is clear. However, the use of Portuguese for variable names and comments might be a barrier for non-Portuguese speakers. Additionally, the use of magic numbers like \u00272\u0027 for color selection could be replaced with named constants for better readability.","tokens":477,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a mathematical approach to determine the first month of the quarter. However, it lacks comments and context, making it less readable for those unfamiliar with the ENUMS array or the ordinal() method. The use of magic numbers (3) without explanation can also hinder understanding. Adding comments and clarifying the ENUMS array would improve readability.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and follows standard Java conventions, making it easy to read and understand. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 clearly indicates its purpose, and the logic for determining a leap year is correctly implemented using a straightforward conditional statement. The use of boolean expressions is clear, but the \u0027else\u0027 block is unnecessary since the \u0027if\u0027 block already returns a value.","tokens":305,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with a well-named method and variable. It uses a constant for PI, which is good practice. The logic for calculating the area of a circle is straightforward and correct. The only minor improvement could be using Java\u0027s Math.PI for better precision, but this does not significantly impact readability.","tokens":273,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with a well-named method \u0027calcularAreaTrianguloIsosceles\u0027 that indicates its purpose. The parameters \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027altura\u0027 are appropriately named, making the calculation straightforward. The use of a temporary variable \u0027area\u0027 is not strictly necessary but does not hinder readability. Overall, the code is easy to understand and follows standard Java conventions.","tokens":287,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses descriptive variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. The method combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object, updating count, simpleSum, and adjusting sums with compensation. The use of Math.min and Math.max for min and max is clear. However, the purpose of sumWithCompensation is not immediately obvious without further context, slightly reducing readability.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear logic to calculate the new month by adding a given number of months. The use of modulo operation ensures the result stays within the bounds of the 12 months. However, the use of \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 assumes familiarity with the context, which might not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the surrounding code. Overall, it\u0027s readable but requires some understanding of the context.","tokens":295,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
