{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, which are understandable for Portuguese speakers. However, it lacks comments and proper formatting, such as missing semicolons and braces, which can hinder readability. The use of modulo operation is clear, but the logic could be more explicit with additional context or comments.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for conditional logic, which is efficient but can be slightly less readable for those unfamiliar with it. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 is in Portuguese, which might not be clear to non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, checking if \u0027getContagem()\u0027 is greater than 0 before performing division, preventing division by zero. Overall, it\u0027s well-structured and easy to understand for those familiar with the language.","tokens":301,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable but has several issues. Variable names like \u0027soma\u0027 and \u0027numeros\u0027 are in Portuguese, which might not be clear to non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is complex, with nested loops and conditional operations that are not immediately intuitive. The use of String arrays for numeric operations is unconventional and could be optimized. Comments or clearer variable names would improve comprehension.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. The logic for selecting a font and color based on the index is clear. However, the use of Portuguese for variable names and comments might be a barrier for non-Portuguese speakers. Additionally, the purpose of some variables like \u0027contagemNomes\u0027 and \u0027geradorNomes\u0027 is not immediately clear without further context.","tokens":482,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a straightforward calculation to determine the first month of the quarter. However, it lacks comments explaining the logic, which could hinder understanding for those unfamiliar with the ordinal() method or the ENUMS array. Adding comments or more descriptive variable names would improve readability.","tokens":252,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, implementing a well-known algorithm to determine leap years. The use of logical operators is straightforward, and the method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is descriptive for Portuguese speakers. The code could be slightly improved by directly returning the boolean expression, eliminating the if-else structure, but overall, it is easy to understand.","tokens":299,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and straightforward, with a descriptive method name \u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 indicating its purpose. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability. Variable names are intuitive, and the logic is simple. However, the code could slightly improve by using Java\u0027s Math.PI for better precision. Overall, it\u0027s easy to understand and well-structured.","tokens":280,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with descriptive method and parameter names that make its purpose evident. The calculation of the area of an isosceles triangle is straightforward and correctly implemented. The only minor improvement could be adding comments for educational purposes, but it\u0027s not necessary for such a simple function.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. It performs a combination of statistics by updating count, sum, and min/max values. However, the method sumWithCompensation is not defined here, which could affect comprehension if the reader is unfamiliar with its implementation. Overall, the logic is straightforward, but the missing context slightly reduces readability.","tokens":309,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear logic to calculate the new month by adding a given number of months. The use of modulo operation ensures the month wraps around correctly. However, the use of \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 assumes context not provided in the snippet, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the surrounding code. Adding comments or context would improve readability.","tokens":283,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
