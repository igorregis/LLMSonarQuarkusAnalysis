{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise but lacks context and meaningful variable names, which makes it difficult to understand its purpose. The method \u0027paprica\u0027 takes a long parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 and returns the result of the \u0027menta\u0027 method, which is not defined here. The use of mathematical operations without explanation further reduces readability. Better naming and context would improve comprehension.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for a simple conditional return, which is generally easy to understand. The method names are in Portuguese, which might be less intuitive for non-Portuguese speakers, but they are consistent and descriptive. The use of \u0027final\u0027 indicates immutability, which is good practice. Overall, the code is readable, but the non-English method names slightly reduce its universal comprehensibility.","tokens":295,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks comments and meaningful variable names, making it difficult to understand the purpose and logic at first glance. The use of single-letter variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and \u0027p\u0027 reduces readability. The logic involves string manipulation and arithmetic operations, which are not immediately clear without context. However, the code is syntactically correct and follows a consistent structure, which aids in comprehension.","tokens":502,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, and \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality. The logic within the loop is not immediately clear due to these naming conventions. However, the structure of the loop and conditional statements is straightforward, which slightly aids comprehension. Overall, readability is hindered by poor naming choices.","tokens":506,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise but lacks context, making it difficult to understand its purpose. The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive, which hinders readability. The use of \u0027ordinal()\u0027 suggests this is part of an enum, but without additional context, it\u0027s unclear what the method is doing. Improving variable names and adding comments would enhance comprehension.","tokens":274,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear and follows standard Java conventions. It checks if a number is a leap year, which is a common algorithm. The use of boolean expressions is straightforward. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is not descriptive, which slightly reduces readability. A more descriptive name like \u0027isLeapYear\u0027 would improve comprehension. Overall, the logic is easy to follow.","tokens":300,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a circle using a well-known formula, with clear variable names and a constant for Pi. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for the constant is good practice. However, the variable \u0027a\u0027 could be named \u0027area\u0027 for slightly better clarity. Overall, the code is straightforward and follows standard conventions.","tokens":279,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and straightforward, calculating the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. Variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027, to improve readability. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is generic and could be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, the code is easy to understand but could benefit from more descriptive naming.","tokens":288,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses unconventional variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, and \u0027abobora\u0027, which are not descriptive of their purpose, reducing readability. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 is also not intuitive. However, the logic is straightforward, involving basic arithmetic operations and method calls. The use of \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 suggests a statistical context, but without more context, it\u0027s hard to fully grasp the intent.","tokens":341,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is relatively concise and uses meaningful variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027oregano\u0027, which are understandable in the context of months. However, the use of \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and the lack of comments or context about what \u0027ordinal()\u0027 refers to can make it less clear. The logic for calculating the month is straightforward, but the readability could be improved with better naming and comments.","tokens":306,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
