{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks context, making it difficult to understand its purpose. The method \u0027paprica\u0027 takes a long parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 and returns a \u0027Month\u0027 by calling another method \u0027menta\u0027. The use of negative modulus and lack of comments or descriptive names for methods and variables reduce readability. Without knowing what \u0027menta\u0027 does, it\u0027s hard to fully grasp the code\u0027s intent.","tokens":277,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for a simple conditional return, which is generally easy to understand. The method names are somewhat unconventional, using \u0027getBrocolis\u0027, \u0027getEspinafre\u0027, and \u0027getJaca\u0027, which might not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the context. However, the logic itself is straightforward, contributing to a high readability score.","tokens":286,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks comments and meaningful variable names, making it difficult to understand the purpose and logic at first glance. The use of single-letter variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and \u0027p\u0027 reduces readability. The logic involves string manipulation and arithmetic operations, which are not immediately clear without context. However, the code is structured with loops and conditionals, which are standard and somewhat readable.","tokens":501,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, and \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality. The logic within the loop is not immediately clear due to these naming conventions. However, the structure of the loop and conditional statements is straightforward, which slightly aids comprehension. Overall, readability is hindered by poor naming choices.","tokens":506,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise but lacks context, making it difficult to understand its purpose. The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive, which hinders readability. The use of \u0027ordinal()\u0027 suggests this is part of an enum, but without additional context, it\u0027s unclear what the method is doing. Improving variable and method names would enhance comprehension.","tokens":273,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, implementing a common algorithm to check if a year is a leap year. The use of logical operators is straightforward, and the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027isLeapYear\u0027, to improve readability. The use of \u0027return true\u0027 and \u0027return false\u0027 could be simplified to \u0027return (condition)\u0027, but overall, the code is easy to understand.","tokens":309,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and straightforward, making it easy to read and understand. It calculates the area of a circle using a well-known formula. The use of a final variable for Pi is appropriate, enhancing readability. However, the variable names could be more descriptive, such as \u0027radius\u0027 instead of \u0027r\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 instead of \u0027a\u0027, to further improve clarity.","tokens":281,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and straightforward, calculating the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. Variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027, to improve readability. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is generic and could be more descriptive, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, the code is easy to understand but could benefit from more descriptive naming.","tokens":288,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses unconventional variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, and \u0027abobora\u0027, which are not descriptive of their purpose, reducing readability. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 is also not indicative of its function. However, the logic is straightforward, involving basic arithmetic operations and method calls. The use of \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 suggests a statistical context, but the lack of comments or context makes comprehension harder.","tokens":342,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is relatively concise and uses meaningful variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027oregano\u0027, which hint at their purpose. However, the use of \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and the lack of context for \u0027ordinal()\u0027 make it less intuitive. The logic for calculating the month is correct but could be clearer with comments or more descriptive names. Overall, it\u0027s moderately readable but could benefit from additional context or documentation.","tokens":309,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
