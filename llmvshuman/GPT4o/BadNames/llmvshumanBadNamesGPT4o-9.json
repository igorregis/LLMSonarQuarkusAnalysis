{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise but lacks context and meaningful variable names, which makes it difficult to understand its purpose. The method \u0027paprica\u0027 takes a long parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 and returns the result of the \u0027menta\u0027 method, which is not defined here. The use of mathematical operations without explanation further reduces readability. Better naming and context would improve comprehension.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for a simple conditional return, which is generally easy to understand. The method names are somewhat unconventional, using \u0027getBrocolis\u0027, \u0027getEspinafre\u0027, and \u0027getJaca\u0027, which may not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the context. However, the logic itself is straightforward, contributing to good readability.","tokens":284,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks comments and meaningful variable names, making it difficult to understand the purpose and logic at first glance. The use of single-letter variable names like \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and \u0027p\u0027 reduces readability. The logic involves string manipulation and arithmetic operations, which are not immediately clear without context. However, the code is syntactically correct and follows a consistent structure, which aids in comprehension.","tokens":502,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality. The use of food-related names like \u0027inhame\u0027, \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027, and \u0027abobora\u0027 does not convey meaningful information about their roles. The logic within the loop is not immediately clear due to these naming choices. However, the structure of the loop and conditional statements is straightforward, which slightly aids comprehension.","tokens":510,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise but lacks context and clarity. The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are not descriptive, making it difficult to understand their purpose. The use of \u0027ordinal()\u0027 suggests this is part of an enum, but without additional context, it\u0027s hard to grasp the logic. Improving variable names and adding comments would enhance readability.","tokens":270,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, implementing a common algorithm to check if a year is a leap year. The use of boolean expressions within the if statement is straightforward. However, the return statement could be simplified to \u0027return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);\u0027 to improve readability by eliminating the if-else structure. Overall, the code is easy to understand.","tokens":317,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. It calculates the area of a circle using a clear formula. The use of a constant for Pi improves readability. Variable names are short but contextually clear. However, the method name \u0027calc\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027calculateCircleArea\u0027, to enhance clarity. Overall, the code is well-structured and straightforward.","tokens":280,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and straightforward, calculating the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. Variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027base\u0027 and \u0027height\u0027, to improve readability. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is generic and could be more specific, like \u0027calculateTriangleArea\u0027. Overall, the code is easy to understand with minor improvements needed for clarity.","tokens":287,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses unconventional variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, and \u0027abobora\u0027, which are not descriptive of their purpose, reducing readability. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 is also not indicative of its function. However, the logic is straightforward, involving basic arithmetic operations and method calls. The use of \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 suggests a statistical context, but without clear naming, comprehension is hindered.","tokens":341,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is relatively concise and uses meaningful variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027oregano\u0027, which suggest a culinary theme. However, the use of \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and the lack of context for \u0027ordinal()\u0027 make it slightly harder to understand without additional context. The logic for calculating the month is clear, but the readability could be improved with comments or more descriptive names.","tokens":303,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
