{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, with clear comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose and behavior. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is descriptive, and the logic is straightforward, using modular arithmetic to handle month subtraction. The use of \u0027soma\u0027 suggests a consistent naming convention. The only minor issue is the lack of context for the \u0027soma\u0027 method, but overall, the code is highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":379,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it easy to understand. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 clearly indicates its purpose, and the use of a ternary operator for conditional logic is straightforward. The comments provide additional context about the method\u0027s behavior and special cases. The only minor improvement could be to ensure that the method and comments are in English for broader accessibility.","tokens":383,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is generally clear and follows a logical structure, with comments explaining the steps of the Modulo 10 calculation. However, the use of String arrays and multiple conversions between String and Integer could be optimized for better performance and readability. The variable naming is adequate, but the logic could be simplified by using more descriptive variable names and reducing the number of conversions. Overall, the code is understandable but could be improved for clarity.","tokens":940,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names, making it relatively easy to understand. The comments provide useful context, explaining the purpose of the method and certain decisions, such as why \u0027add()\u0027 is not used. However, the use of Portuguese in comments might be a barrier for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, but the readability could be improved by breaking down complex expressions and ensuring consistent formatting.","tokens":571,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear logic to determine the first month of the quarter by dividing the ordinal value by 3. The use of ENUMS array is efficient for this purpose. The comments are detailed and provide a good understanding of the method\u0027s purpose. However, the ENUMS array is not defined in the snippet, which could slightly hinder comprehension if not familiar with the context.","tokens":378,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, with a well-defined purpose and straightforward logic. The use of comments and Javadoc enhances understanding, and the logic for determining a leap year is correctly implemented. The only minor improvement could be the removal of the else statement, as the return true already exits the method, making the else redundant.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable and easy to understand. It includes clear comments explaining the purpose of the method and the parameters. The use of a constant for PI is good practice, and the formula for calculating the area of a circle is straightforward. The method name is descriptive, and the code follows standard Java conventions, making it accessible even to those with basic Java knowledge.","tokens":352,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable and easy to understand. It includes a clear and concise comment explaining the purpose of the method, as well as detailed parameter and return descriptions. The method name is descriptive, and the formula for calculating the area is straightforward. The use of comments within the method further enhances comprehension. Overall, the code is well-structured and follows best practices for readability.","tokens":364,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and includes a concise Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The logic within the method is straightforward, performing arithmetic operations and using Math functions to update statistics. The only minor issue is the lack of context for the \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 method, but overall, the code is highly readable.","tokens":366,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The method itself is concise and uses straightforward arithmetic to calculate the resulting month. The use of modulo operation ensures correct wrapping around the year. The only minor improvement could be more context on ENUMS and ordinal(), but overall, it\u0027s highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":384,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
