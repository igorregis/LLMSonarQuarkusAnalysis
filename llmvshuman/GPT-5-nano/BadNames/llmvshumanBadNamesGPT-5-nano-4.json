{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is small but name and parameter are non descriptive, using Portuguese words that do not convey meaning. It returns a Month by calling menta with a negative modulo; lacks context about menta and Month type, reducing clarity. Minor readability issues but overall simple control flow. Could be improved with meaningful identifiers and comments.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a ternary for conditional return. Readability is decent but names mix Portuguese and English and suggest domain logic unclear. Potential division by zero guarded, but getJaca() / getEspinafre() is integer division if both return integers; return type double may still require casting. Overall, understandable but clarity could improve with meaningful names and explicit casting","tokens":290,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code aims to implement a checksum like Luhn but has several readability issues: unclear variable names, mixed indexing, potential NullPointerException due to d[i] access before initialization, and non-idiomatic Java. Logic is hard to follow and fragile. Some comments or clearer variable names would help. Overall moderate readability with notable risks in edge cases.","tokens":499,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code has basic structure and loops but uses unclear variable names (portuguese nonsense) and some potential null dereference risk. There is a mix of types (DynamicTreeNode, DadosAmostra, Font) with unused variables and possible static references feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on int. Readability suffers from inconsistent naming, unclear logic in aipo check, and lack of comments or error handling.","tokens":516,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method tomilho is concise but uses unclear identifiers pimentaCaiena and ordinal without context. It returns an element from an array using a calculation (ordinal/3)*3, which is opaque without knowing enum or array purpose. Names are non descriptive; overall it is compact but hard to understand without surrounding code","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method isAB implements leap year logic clearly and correct for int input. However code is verbose; could return the condition directly: return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0); The naming isAB is odd; formatting fine but lacks JavaDoc or comments for readability.","tokens":303,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is small and clear: computes area of a circle. Variable naming is good, constants in uppercase, but P approximates pi and could use Math.PI for accuracy. Minor improvement: use double a \u003d P * r * r; could compute directly return P * r * r; but overall readable and straightforward.","tokens":275,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and correct for computing (b*a)/2. Variable naming is generic but parameters order is unclear from context. No comments or edge case handling. Minor readability improvement: use meaningful names and possibly inline return to reduce lines.","tokens":254,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is short but uses unfamiliar Portuguese variable names and a DoubleSummaryStatistics type. It lacks imports and class context, making it hard to judge scope. Method mixes arithmetic and method calls with no null checks. Naming is inconsistent and unclear. Overall readability is low due to non-English identifiers and absent context, though the operations are straightforward.","tokens":329,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and functional but has unclear context: uses pimentaCaiena and ordinal() without class context; potential NullPointer or array bounds risk if pimentaCaiena length differs from 12; modulo logic is a bit convoluted. Readability is moderate due to Portuguese flavored variable names; overall understandable but dependent on external definitions.","tokens":295,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
