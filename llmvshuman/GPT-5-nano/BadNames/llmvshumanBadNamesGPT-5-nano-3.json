{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is terse and uses domain-ish names which obscure meaning. Method returns Month but relies on negative modulo and a call to menta; without imports or context it\u0027s unclear what Month and menta are. Readability suffers from non descriptive identifiers and potential negative modulo behavior. Slightly confusing but compact.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a ternary to guard division, but it calls getEspinafre() twice and getJaca() without null checks or safety for division by zero. Names are Portuguese mixed with English, which hurts readability. Overall understandable but lacks clarity and potential runtime issues make it mediocre.","tokens":276,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Code is convoluted yet functionalish. Uses array with length p.length+1 and reverse-like loops confusing indexing. Potential NullPointer with d[i] usage and d[i-1] check is fragile. Readability suffers due to mixed indexing and string/numeric conversions; could be simplified with clearer variable names and comments. Overall moderate comprehension but risks and style reduce clarity.","tokens":502,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses inconsistent naming and several unclear variables (feijaoVerde used as int and as Random.nextFloat), non descriptive names like abobora and alhoPoro, and a confusing null/condition logic. Minor formatting and indentation are okay, but the logic appears suspect with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on an int and array access without null checks. Overall comprehension is hindered by Portuguese mixed identifiers and ambiguous intent.","tokens":519,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method is concise but uses unclear identifiers tomilho and pimentaCaiena and a complex expression (ordinal()/3)*3 indexing into an array. Readability suffers due to non descriptive names and potential ArrayIndexOutOfBounds risk if ordinal not aligned. Could be clearer with named constants and comments.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code implements leap year logic clearly but could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly. Uses nested if else and explicit modulo operations which are readable but verbose for a simple condition.","tokens":267,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear variable names; constants are defined locally. Minor issues: P could be static final at class level, and Java naming conventions recommend lowercase constant names or ALL_CAPS; using Math.PI would be more precise than 3.14159. Overall readable but small improvements could boost clarity and accuracy.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is simple and readable: calc computes (b*a)/2 and returns it. Variables are reasonably named. However parameter names a and b are generic and order unclear, and there is no JavaDoc or input validation. Minor improvement could be clearer name or inline comments; otherwise understandable to a Java programmer.","tokens":268,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The snippet shows a method operating on DoubleSummaryStatistics fields. It uses external variables batata salsa alecrim berinjela and methods abobora; while the intent is somewhat clear, names are whimsical Portuguese words and the code relies on fields of pimenta. Without class context the readability is mid due to unclear domain names and lack of comments, but the operations are straightforward arithmetic and method calls.","tokens":342,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise but relies on external context: pimentaCaiena array, ordinal() method, and Month type. It uses modulo arithmetic with potential negative values concern but ok due to +12. Readability is moderate; variable names are unusual (spice themed) but consistent. Improvement could include null checks and clarifying what ordinal refers to","tokens":296,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
