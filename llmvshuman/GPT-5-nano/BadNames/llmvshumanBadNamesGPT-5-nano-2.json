{"score":"3","reasoning":" concise but cryptic. Method name and parameter names are Portuguese words but not meaningful, returning menta with a negative modulo expression may be unclear without context. No class or import context. Readability is low due to unclear semantics and use of nonstandard identifiers. ","tokens":252,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses a ternary to handle division by zero. However the naming is inconsistent with Portuguese/English mix and the logic depends on getEspinafre and getJaca semantics which are unclear. Also potential integer division if getJaca returns int; return type double mitigates but code could be clearer with casts. Overall readable but not self explanatory","tokens":288,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has multiple off by one patterns and unclear variable naming. It uses arrays of length p.length+1 with indices offset, loops reversed, and lacks null checks in places. The DSA logic appears to implement a checksum like Luhn but is hard to follow and error-prone. Minor formatting issues reduce readability; overall comprehension requires careful tracing.","tokens":497,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code uses meaningful Portuguese identifiers but mixes languages and unclear context. Variable names like inhame feijaoVerde and aipo are confusing. There are potential nulls and static fields (DynamicTreeNode.GRAO_DE_BICO, MILHOS) that are not defined here. Logic is straightforward loop with conditionals, but readability suffers from inconsistent naming, lack of comments, and unclear types (DadosAmostra, DynamicTreeNode).","tokens":522,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Codigo muy corto confuso: utiliza pimentaCaiena y ordinal sin contexto, calculo posible fuera de rango y nombre poco descriptivo. Lectura dificulta prioridad de variables y metodo tomilho mezcla portugues y ingles. Falta claridad sobre objetivo y tipos, aumentando dificultad de mantenimiento.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code implements leap year logic clearly and uses a standard if/else. However it could be simplified to return directly the boolean expression and formatted with consistent spacing for better readability","tokens":265,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear and concise calculation of area of a circle using a local constant P and parameter r. Variable names are short but understandable. Minor issue: P is not declared as static final; using Math.PI would be more accurate. The method is straightforward and readable, but could improve with Javadoc and naming consistency","tokens":271,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clean minimal method that computes (b*a)/2 and returns it. readable variable names, straightforward arithmetic. Could improve by parameter naming clarity or adding Javadoc and edge-case handling. No unusual constructs, but lacks comments and nullability checks are irrelevant for primitives.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method uses unclear identifiers in Portuguese mixed with English, and relies on an unfamiliar DoubleSummaryStatistics API field access (pimenta.batata etc.). Without full context, variable declarations and side effects are ambiguous. Naming inconsistency and lack of comments reduce readability; overall comprehension is limited to experienced Java developers familiar with the domain.","tokens":328,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise but uses unclear variable names that hinder readability: menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena, ordinal. It relies on this.ordinal() or a static context? Without class context, readability suffers. The arithmetic is odd but straightforward: modulo 12, cast to int, array access with computed index. Overall moderate clarity but naming and missing context reduce understanding.","tokens":308,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
