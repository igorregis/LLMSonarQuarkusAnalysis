{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is compact but cryptic: a method named paprica returns a Month and calls menta with a negative modulo; without imports or context it is unclear how Month or menta are defined. Readability suffers from non descriptive names and unclear intent. Minor points: proper formatting and consistent naming would help. Overall easy to follow line but semantics opaque","tokens":270,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses a ternary to prevent division by zero. However there is potential division result type by double, but getJaca() may be int; implicit casting could be unclear. The method name mix of Portuguese and English may affect readability. Overall logic is straightforward but without context of methods called, readability could be improved with explicit casts and comments.","tokens":288,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is hard to read due to non descriptive variable names and indexing off by one risks. The logic resembles Luhn but with confusing array bounds and null checks. Minor formatting issues like unnecessary String.valueOf and Integer.valueOf. Potential NullPointerException in d[i] usage and array bounds in final loop. Overall readability is low; it would benefit from clearer naming and safer indexing.","tokens":504,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Variable names are mostly non descriptive (coxa, abobora, feijaoVerde) and Portuguese mixed with English, some type names unclear in context (DynamicTreeNode, DadosAmostra). There is a potential bug with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() since feijaoVerde is int. Control flow is straightforward but readability suffers from inconsistent naming and unclear intent.","tokens":511,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is short but cryptic. It uses array pimentaCaiena with index (ordinal()/3)*3 and returns a Month. Without context of enum Month or array, readability suffers due to non descriptive names and magic arithmetic. Slightly decipherable but overall unclear.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code implements leap year logic clearly with a straightforward condition and explicit return. Minor improvement: remove unnecessary else and directly return the boolean expression. Overall readable but could benefit from proper formatting and a brief method comment.","tokens":273,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear variable names, with a conventional PI approximation. However, it lacks JavaDoc, access modifiers, and nullability checks are unnecessary here but formatting could improve readability (e.g., using Math.PI). Overall readable but basic and minimal documentation.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and readable with clear variable names. However parameter order b, a could be confusing without context; using descriptive names like base and height would improve clarity. Minor improvement: return directly (b * a) / 2; to reduce one variable. Overall understandable but not exemplary.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Function uses DoubleSummaryStatistics fields directly, some domain names unclear but structure is simple. Reads: updates fields, calls abobora with object and negated value, uses Math.min/Math.max. Naming is inconsistent (food terms) which hurts readability. Overall straightforward but without context, property access and method semantics rely on external definitions.","tokens":328,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is compact and uses simple arithmetic to map a long to a Month via an array pimentaCaiena. Readability is moderate but relies on unclear variables nozMoscada oregano and pimentaCaiena and a call to ordinal(); without context it is hard to verify array bounds and Month origin. Minor naming confusion but overall comprehensible for experienced Java dev.","tokens":299,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
