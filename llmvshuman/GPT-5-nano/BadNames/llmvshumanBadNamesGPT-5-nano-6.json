{"score":"3","reasoning":"The snippet shows a method with minimal context: public Month paprica(long alecrim) { return menta(-(alecrim % 12)); } It uses unclear identifiers and a call to menta, which is undefined here. Readability suffers due to non descriptive names and lack of imports or class context. Logic is simple but ambiguous without type Month and method menta","tokens":275,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but relies on other methods whose behavior is unclear. It uses a ternary to avoid division by zero but does not handle potential integer division if getJaca returns int; could cause truncation. Naming mix of Portuguese words may reduce clarity for non bilingual readers. Overall moderate readability but missing null checks and explicit types in operands.","tokens":284,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code attempts a Luhn-like check but has multiple issues: array indexing uses length and starts from end, potential NullPointer and NumberFormatExceptions, and unclear variable naming. The loops and string arithmetic are convoluted, and there is no handling for p being null or empty. Overall readability is low due to confusing index logic and mixed responsibilities in a single method.","tokens":501,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is terse and relies on array indexing with ordinal math, which is hard to follow without context. Naming is in Portuguese with misaligned semantics compared to a typical Month enum, and the expression((ordinal()/3)*3) is obscure. Overall readability is low due to opaque variable names and unclear intent, though the snippet is syntactically valid.","tokens":272,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method isAB implements leap year logic clearly and correctly using a standard conditional. Readability is decent but could be simplified by returning the boolean expression directly and removing the else branch.","tokens":268,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clarity is good: simple method computes area of circle using a constant pi, descriptive names. Minor improvement: use Math.PI and parameter naming could be more explicit. Overall readable with straightforward logic and minimal risk.","tokens":253,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear variable names but parameter order is non-idiomatic for a calc function; lacks javadoc and comments; could benefit from naming r as result and inline return. Overall readable but minor style and clarity improvements needed","tokens":254,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is compact but relies on non-descriptive identifiers in Portuguese mixed with pseudocode fields like batata/ salsa. Readability suffers due to unclear context and unclear types; no class or imports shown. However, structure is simple: parameter usage, simple arithmetic and a method call. Overall comprehension is moderate but names reduce clarity.","tokens":328,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is short but relies on external context: pimentaCaiena, ordinal(), and array indexing. Readability is moderate; variable names are quirky and not descriptive. The arithmetic uses modulo and casts that could confuse. Overall understandable with some guessing about Month type and array contents, but lacks clarity without class context.","tokens":290,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese identifiers mixed with English, inconsistent naming and unclear context. Variable types are declared but some fields (DynamicTreeNode, aipo, MILHOS) are undefined in snippet, hindering comprehension. The logic is not self explanatory due to obscure names and potential null handling. Overall readability is below average for maintainability but not completely unreadable.","tokens":505,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
