{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is compact but unclear due to non descriptive names (paprica, alecrim, menta). It uses a modulo 12 and negation but lacks context or javadoc. Readability suffers from invented words and no comments. Still, the return type and simple expression are understandable to Java programmers.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact and uses a ternary to avoid division by zero. However the names are Portuguese vegetables causing readability issues for non Portuguese readers. Potential division integer vs double ambiguity depends on getJaca() and getEspinafre() return types; if both ints, division may be integer. Minor clarity improvements needed but overall understandable.","tokens":282,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code has unclear variable names and tricky indexing. Uses String[], multiple loops with off by one risk, and no comments. Some potential NullPointer risk with d[i-1]. Overall logic is hard to follow and not robust.","tokens":474,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is syntactically plausible but uses unclear variable naming and potential logic issues (feijaoVerde assigned from feijaoVerde.nextFloat() is invalid since feijaoVerde is int; mai focus on readability). Local variables have mixed Portuguese/English, no comments, and inconsistent null checks. Overall comprehension is moderate but structure is basic and repetitive; naming harms clarity.","tokens":511,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is compact but cryptic: it uses pimentaCaiena array and ordinal calculation to pick an element. Without context on what Month type or array contains, readability suffers. The expression ((ordinal()/3)*3) may be unclear to readers, potential off by one issues. A clearer approach with named intermediate variables would improve comprehension.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code implements a leap year check using a standard algorithm. It is readable but verbose; the else branch unnecessarily returns false and could be simplified to return the boolean expression directly. Minor improvement possible in formatting and removing redundant braces.","tokens":276,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and clear: computes area of a circle using a local constant P. Readability is decent, but uses a nonstandard constant name and a magic literal for Pi instead of Math.PI. The variable a is redundant since returned immediately. Minor style issues but overall understandable.","tokens":268,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is small and clear: computes (b*a)/2. Parameter names b and a are non descriptive but the calculation is straightforward. Minor readability issues: ambiguous parameter order and no Javadoc. Could improve by naming (base, height) and adding comments or documentation.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is compact and uses familiar Java methods but uses non descriptive identifiers pimenta and others. It modifies fields with pimenta’s stats and calls abobora with a value. Readability is moderate due to unclear domain names and lack of context, but syntax is valid and straightforward.","tokens":317,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact but obscure: uses modulo 12, casts long to int, and references pimentaCaiena and ordinal() without context. Readability suffers due to non descriptive variable names and unclear purpose. Logic seems to map to an array index but lacks null checks and class context. Overall moderate comprehension with naming ambiguity.","tokens":292,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
