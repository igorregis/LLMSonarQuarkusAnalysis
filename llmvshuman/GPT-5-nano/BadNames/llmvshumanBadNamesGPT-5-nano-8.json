{"score":"3","reasoning":"The snippet is extremely compact and cryptic. Method name and parameter are non descriptive, operations rely on modulo and a negation which reduces readability. Without broader context, it is hard to follow the intent. However the code is syntactically valid assuming Month and menta are defined; readability is poor due to unclear naming and lack of comments.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact and uses a ternary to guard division, but names are inconsistent in Portuguese/English mix which hurts readability. Potential division by zero is avoided. Return type double is fine, but integer division risk if getJaca() returns int; ensure double division. Overall understandable but naming and potential type pitfalls reduce clarity.","tokens":281,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code attempts a Luhn-like checksum but has several issues: off-by-one array access, possible NullPointerException, and confusing loop indices. Variable names are non-descriptive. Overall structure is hard to follow and risky due to d[i] dereferences without null checks.","tokens":484,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code uses many Portuguese identifiers which reduces clarity for non bilingual reviewers. It has inconsistent variable naming (feijaoVerde reused as int and later as nextFloat), potential null dereference aipo[feijaoVerde], and unclear meaning of libraries. Overall structure is understandable: a loop creates nodes with alternating colors. Some style issues and possible runtime bugs reduce readability but logic is traceable.","tokens":513,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name tomilho and return pimentaCaiena[(ordinal() / 3) * 3] use non descriptive identifiers. It relies on unclear fields pimentaCaiena and ordinal(), and arithmetic indexing. Without context, it is hard to understand intent or ensure safety. Minor readability improvements could be achieved with descriptive names and comments.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method clearly implements leap year logic with readable condition. Could simplify by returning the condition directly and avoid redundant else. Minor formatting and whitespace fine for comprehension.","tokens":262,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is clear: calculates area using pi constant and returns it. Readability is decent though P could be static final outside method for reuse; variable names are conventional. minor improvement: use Math.PI for accuracy and rename P to PI or use a parameter like r. Overall easy to understand but slightly conventional.","tokens":273,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses meaningful parameter names. However the order b and a is unusual and the formula lacks a clear context. No input validation or Javadoc. Minor readability issue is the transient variable r; could return directly. Overall understandable but not self explanatory","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code uses unclear Portuguese variable names; parameters and methods mix Java conventions. While syntactically plausible, the meaning of fields like batata, salsa, tomato etc is opaque without context. The usage of DoubleSummaryStatistics suggests aggregation, but the field access pimenta. suspects inner state. Overall readability is limited by non-descriptive identifiers and minimal comments.","tokens":333,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact and Java familiar: casts long to int, modular arithmetic, and array indexing with ordinal. However it relies on ordinal() without class context, and pimentaCaiena array may be undefined here. The expression (oregano + 12) is unnecessary since modulo 12 handles it. Readability is moderate but could confuse due to Spanish/Portuguese smelling identifiers and mix of domain metaphors.","tokens":310,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
