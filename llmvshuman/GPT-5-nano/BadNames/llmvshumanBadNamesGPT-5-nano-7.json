{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is small but uses unclear variable names and a non descriptive return. It relies on a static method menta and a modulo operation with negative handling, which may confuse readers. Overall readability is low due to meaningless identifiers; functionality is minimal but not self explanatory.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and readable but uses unclear domain terms (brocolis, espinafre, jaca). It has a simple ternary and division which could risk division by zero, but check prevents it. Overall understandable but naming reduces clarity and potential for subtle bugs in real use.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is hard to follow due to confusing indexing going out of bounds risks and mixed responsibilities. The intent seems like Luhn check, but incorrect array bounds (d.length, i \u003e 0) cause potential NullPointer or ArrayIndex issues. Variable names are non descriptive. Overall readability is poor; algorithm fragile and hard to reason about quickly.","tokens":496,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Nomes estranhos e misturas de idiomas causam confusão; uso de variáveis sem explicação clara; alguns nomes como feijaoVerde nao seguem convenção; falta de comentários e de verificação de nulos; entretanto a estrutura do loop e a criação de objetos sao diretas, com fluxo compreensível.","tokens":501,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is terse and uses unclear identifiers (tomilho, pimentaCaiena) which harms readability. It assumes ordinal() is defined and uses a calculation to index an array, but lacks bounds checks and context. Minor readability gains from using meaningful names and constants, but overall comprehension is hampered by non-English names and opaque logic.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method implements leap year logic clearly but the else branch is unnecessary since the condition itself returns a boolean. Could be simplified to return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0); The code uses straightforward arithmetic and is readable, though minor simplification would improve clarity.","tokens":301,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear and concise method computing circle area using a constant PI. Variable names are readable. Minor improvement: use Math.PI and maybe rename P to PI or make static final. Overall straightforward but lacking comments and input validation; no edge-case handling.","tokens":259,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear simple method calculates (b*a)/2 and returns result. Parameter naming b and a may be confusing order but arithmetic straightforward. No comments or null checks. Readability decent but could improve with descriptive names and inline documentation.","tokens":251,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method uses non descriptive names and relies on external state. Parameters have a descriptive type but fields like batata, salsa, etc are unclear without class context. Minor readability issues but structure is simple and easy to follow once variable meanings known; lacks comments or proper naming reduces understandability","tokens":318,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is compact and uses simple arithmetic to select an element from pimentaCaiena. Readability is moderate: variable names are quirky but consistent. Potential issues: method relies on menta return type Month and uses ordinal() which suggests this is inside an enum or class with such method; unclear context for pimentaCaiena array and the cast from long to int may hide negative values; modulo with negative could behave unexpectedly in some cases.","tokens":314,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
