{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is compact but cryptic: names are meaningless Portuguese words, which hinders readability. The intent is unclear and modulus with 12 plus negation adds confusion. Without surrounding context or Javadoc, comprehension is low. Minor clarity gains could be achieved with descriptive names and comments.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The ternary is clear but names are non descriptive (brocolis, espinafre) which hurts readability; division of two possibly int methods without casting may cause integer division if getJaca returns int. Method returns double but cast missing; overall easy to follow but naming and potential type issue reduce clarity","tokens":276,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is hard to read due to non descriptive names and complex indexing. Potential off by one errors in arrays and loops are not obvious. Logic mixing string and int conversions reduces clarity. Comments absent. Overall understandable but prone to bugs; readability could be improved with meaningful names and boundary checks.","tokens":485,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but uses unclear variable names pimentaCaiena and ordinal, implying domain specific code. Without context, logic is odd: index derived from ordinal()/3 *3 may be intended to snap to multiples of 3. Readability suffers due to non descriptive identifiers and lack of class context; code compiles if types align but understanding is limited.","tokens":273,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method isAB clearly implements leap year logic with concise condition. Minor improvement: could return the condition directly without if-else, e.g., return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0); The code is readable and idiomatic, though verbose for a simple boolean.","tokens":303,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clear and concise method computes area of a circle using a constant Pi. Variable names are meaningful, and final P conveys constant. However Pi value is imprecise and there is no Javadoc or comments; minor stylistic improvements possible like using Math.PI and parameter validation.","tokens":265,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and clear, uses meaningful names b and a but order is unclear and variable r is unnecessary; could simplify to return (b*a)/2. No nulls or exceptions. Minor readability issue due to parameter naming and intermediate variable.","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Codigo corto mezcla variables de clase sin contexto claro. Uso de DoubleSummaryStatistics como tipo parametro pero referencias a fields como batata salsa etc sin definir. operaciones sin comentarios ni nombres consistentes: pimenta.batata etc. Faltan imports, visibilidade y contrato. Legibilidad pobre por nombres ambigüos y falta de contexto","tokens":330,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact but relies on fields pimentaCaiena and ordinal() which are not shown. It casts a long to int, uses modulo and array access with potential negative indices if ordinal() or oregano negative, though oregano is nonnegative. Clarity is moderate; could improve by explicit null checks or bounds and documenting behavior.","tokens":293,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names and mixed Portuguese/English, reducing readability. Minor issues: feijaoVerde used before initialization as a float for nextFloat, possible NullPointer risk with aipo, and confusing ternary logic. Loop uses magic constants and ambiguous methods. Overall structure is readable but variable naming and potential runtime errors hinder comprehension.","tokens":501,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
