{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code fragment is short and uses Portuguese method names; readability is hindered by missing braces and potential null safety and type import for Month. The expression soma(-(meses % 12)) assumes existence of methods and context; without formatting and full class, comprehension is limited.","tokens":251,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses a clear ternary to avoid division by zero. Potential improvement: ensure getSoma and getContagem return types align for division (double vs int) to avoid integer division; add Javadoc for method purpose; spacing is acceptable but could be more consistent.","tokens":269,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code implements a DV calculation but uses confusing index handling and string arrays. The logic is hard to follow due to mixed use of indices and null checks, and potential NullPointer/ArrayIndex issues. Variable names are in Portuguese which is fine for context but not self documenting. Overall functional but not clean or robust; could be simplified and comments added.","tokens":513,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Codigo aparece funcional e usa nomes desenhados. Variaveis em Portugues ajudam contexto. Falta de comentarios e alguns trechos podem gerar ambiguidade: uso de canDisplayUpTo parece estranho, tratamento de fonte pode levar a NullPointer; loop simples, separa responsabilidades pouco. Estruturas basicas claras, indentacao razoavel, mas nomes de classes dependentes dificultam leitura sem contexto.","tokens":485,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method has a compact one-liner using ordinal and array access. Readability relies on knowing ENUMS and ordinal context; lacks method or class context, comments, and bounds safety. Primitive naming in Portuguese may hinder non Portuguese readers. Overall easy to follow for experienced dev but obscure without surrounding code.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Function isAnoBissexto clearly implements leap year logic. It uses a standard conditional that is easy to read. Minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly without if-else, but readability remains high and logic is correct.","tokens":280,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and clear: computes circle area using PI constant. However PI is locally defined rather than using Math.PI, reducing precision and consistency with Java norms; naming is Portuguese; formatting is acceptable but could improve with JavaDoc and consistent indentation.","tokens":264,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Nomear o metodo em portugues ajuda, mas a formula de area de triangulo isosceles esta errada pois a area depende da altura correspondente a base; no codigo a logica de area esta correta para um triângulo qualquer com base e altura. A indentacao pequena, falta de comentarios e visibilidade do modificador podem reduzir legibilidade","tokens":284,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The snippet shows a simple combine of statistics member fields. Readability is average: straightforward arithmetic, but lacks context like field declarations, null/empty handling, and JavaDoc. Minor concerns include potential NaN/min/max initial values and potential data race in multithreaded contexts. Overall comprehension is okay but not exceptional due to missing surrounding class state.","tokens":310,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is compact but uses unclear logic: casting long to int, modulo 12, and using ordinal with ENUMS array is error prone and hard to read. It assumes 12 months and relies on external ENUMS and ordinal() semantics. Lack of null safety and no bounds checks reduce readability. Overall moderate comprehension but not robust.","tokens":283,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
