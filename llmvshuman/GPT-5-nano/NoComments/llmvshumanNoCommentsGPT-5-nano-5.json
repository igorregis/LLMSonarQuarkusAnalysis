{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is very short but has formatting issues: missing semicolon at end of return statement and no class context. It uses a mix of Portuguese subtrai and soma with modulo 12, which may be unclear to readers. Overall readability is low due to implicit behavior and lack of null/edge-case handling, but the idea is simple.","tokens":266,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"A concise ternary that computes average when contagem \u003e 0. Reads fine but potential integer division if soma and contagem are integers; using double would fix. Method name getMedia suggests Portuguese. Minor formatting and no Javadoc. Overall readable but could improve clarity with explicit types or comments.","tokens":270,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Legibility is moderate but there are issues: using String[] with extra length, manual digit manipulation, and potential null checks or index errors not robust. Variable naming inconsistent (num, numeros), complex loops, and no input validation. Logic error risk in final loop indexing (numeros.length and i-1). Overall comprehension is possible but readability could be improved with clearer naming and safer string to int handling.","tokens":526,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is functional but uses Portuguese identifiers and some unclear context. Variable names like contador, indiceAleatorio, fontes, NOMES, carregarFilhos are descriptive but the logic relies on external fields (geradorNomes, contagemNomes) and side effects (insert, DynamicTreeNode). Minor readability issues: lack of null checks for fontes and Font handling, no comments, mixed ternary style. Overall understandable but could use clearer naming and guards.","tokens":494,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is short but relies on unknown context like ENUMS and ordinal method. It attempts to compute the first month of the quarter but uses integer division and array indexing without bounds checks. Readability is low due to mixed language (primeiroMesDoTrimestre) and unclear ENUMS source. Minor clarity improvement would help, but the logic is compact and somewhat decipherable.","tokens":277,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method clearly implements leap year logic with readable condition. Minor improvement: return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 ano % 100 !\u003d 0) || (ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0); would remove unnecessary if/else and improve conciseness while preserving meaning","tokens":290,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and correct for calculating area of a circle. It uses a local PI constant which is less precise than Math.PI and shadows typical style of using Math.PI. Method name in Portuguese is fine if context matches. Overall readable but could improve by using Math.PI and adding a Javadoc or parameter validation.","tokens":277,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"A simple method computes triangle area for an isosceles case but the formula is generic for any triangle. Code uses clear names but lacks input validation and proper Java formatting like indentation or class context. The method name is descriptive in Portuguese, yet comments or JavaDoc would improve readability.","tokens":270,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward but lacks null checks and context for fields like sumCompensation and min/max initialization. Naming is clear, but there is no finalization or validation. Overall readable but could improve with comments and defensive checks","tokens":286,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is small but uses implicit knowledge about enum array and ordinal, with a potential bug for negative months and cast loss. Readability is moderate but relies on surrounding ENUMS and ordinal(). Minimal documentation. Overall acceptable but could be clearer and handle edge cases.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
