{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but uses Portuguese name subtrai and returns soma with a negative modulo. Lacks class context, missing imports, and potential issues: negative modulo behavior in Java and method chaining without semicolon on return line (semicolon missing). Overall readability is moderate but syntax issues reduce clarity.","tokens":256,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is concise and uses a clear ternary to avoid division by zero. However method names getMedia, getSoma, getContagem imply domain-specific nouns not shown, and there is no type safety for division since getSoma and getContagem return int or double not shown. Minor readability issues due to inline ternary on single line and spacing. Overall understandable with moderate readability.","tokens":289,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Codigo complexo e com indices confusos; nomes em portugues mas sem comentarios; uso de indices dentro de arrays começa em tamanho-1, confunde; logica de calculo de DV pouco claro e possivel NullPointer; falta verificacao de entrada e tratamento de excecoes; estilo: repeticoes manuais e conversoes desnecessarias tornam leitura difusa","tokens":518,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is readable with clear variable names and straightforward logic. Some minor issues: mixing Portuguese and English, potential null handling for fontes, and use of canDisplayUpTo check may be error prone. No comments present. Loop uses constants from DynamicTreeNode and relies on external state. Overall understandable but could benefit from naming consistency and null safety checks.","tokens":472,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise but uses Portuguese name and a non descriptive ENUMS/ordinal concept. It assumes a valid enum context and that ordinal/3 indexing yields a correct first month of a trimester. Readability is moderate but could confuse readers unfamiliar with enum ordinal logic and without full class context","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The function isCorrect and concise. It uses clear condition for leap year and returns true/false directly. Minor improvement could be return (cond); instead of if-else. Overall readable but could remove else for brevity","tokens":278,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is concise and readable: clear naming, simple math, and final PI. Minor issues: PI could use Math.PI for accuracy, and the method could be static in a class context; formatting is good but could benefit from consistent indentation.","tokens":263,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method has a clear purpose and correct formula for triangle area. Naming is descriptive in Portuguese mix with English, which could be slightly inconsistent. Indentation and braces are fine. Local variables are straightforward. Could improve by nullability or input validation and add javadoc. Overall reasonably readable for a Java developer.","tokens":274,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Clarity is decent: method consolidates stats by updating fields, uses meaningful names and simple operations. However lacks null checks or bounds, and uses sumWithCompensation without context. Minor readability issues: mixing primitive updates and a pair of similar methods; could benefit from inline comments or a guard against other being same object.","tokens":304,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is concise but cryptic: it uses modulo arithmetic and relies on ENUMS array and ordinal() without context. Potential off-by-one issues and no null safety. Readability suffers due to unclear intent and lack of comments.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
