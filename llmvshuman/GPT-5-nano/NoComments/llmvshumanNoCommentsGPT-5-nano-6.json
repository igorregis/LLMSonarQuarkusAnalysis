{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is very short but unclear due to missing context: method name subtrai but returns soma with negative, potential side effects from modulo 12 and missing semicolon after return line, indentation poor, lacks import and class context. Basic readability is weak for non-Portuguese readers; overall comprehension is limited.","tokens":260,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and readable using a ternary to guard division by zero. However, it relies on getSoma and getContagem without visible null checks or type details; potential integer division if getSoma or getContagem return int types. Overall understandable but could improve clarity with explicit types and comments.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Variable naming is Portuguese and unclear: calculaDVBase10, num; logic is convoluted. Off by one errors: arrays of length num.length()+1, loops use \u003e0, potential nulls. Integer.valueOf on single chars unnecessary, string parsing overhead. No input validation. Readability suffers due to multi-step digit splitting and mixed responsibilities.","tokens":515,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Legibilidade moderate: clear variable names and structure, but uses Portuguese terms and compact expressions. Minor issues: possible null font handling and Magic numbers (2, 0/1 parity) reduce clarity. Some potential ambiguity in canDisplayUpTo check. Overall straightforward loop building nodes with alternating colors; could benefit inline comments and local temp explanations.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is compact and uses enum array access with ordinal arithmetic. Readability is moderate: unclear what ENUMS is, and depends on enclosing enum structure; naming is in Portuguese which is fine if project standard. Potential off-by-one and null safety concerns exist; overall logic to get first month of quarter is simple but relies on context. ","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"A readable and correct implementation of leap year check with straightforward logic. Could be simplified to return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 (ano % 100 !\u003d 0 || ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0)); but the current form is clear and explicit","tokens":286,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Function has clear purpose and simple math. Portugal style naming varia but readable. PI declared locally instead of using Math.PI; could improve by using Math.PI and validation for negative radius. Overall easy to understand but minor style and robustness improvements needed.","tokens":262,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is concise and correctly computes the area of an isosceles triangle but the formula used is generic triangle area (base*altura/2). The name is descriptive, indentation decent, but missing JavaDoc, access modifier, and input validation. Minor readability improvements could include adding final to variables and comments.","tokens":276,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The snippet shows a straightforward merge of statistics fields; readability is decent. Minor concerns: missing null checks, potential overflow handling, and unclear initialization of min/max before combine. Overall, simple and direct, but lacks context and defensive programming.","tokens":287,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is short and mostly readable but relies on implicit enum array ENUMS and ordinal arithmetic which is error prone. Casting months to int and using modulo 12 on a long could misbehave for large values; using ordinal and a fixed array is brittle. Overall comprehension is moderate but lacks safety and clarity about ENUMS origin and edge cases.","tokens":285,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
