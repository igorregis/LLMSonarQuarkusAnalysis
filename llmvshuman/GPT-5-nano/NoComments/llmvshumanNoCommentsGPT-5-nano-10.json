{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method name and intent are clear but the code lacks formatting and has a potential bug: missing semicolon after return statement and possible confusion with modulo on negative values. Readability is fair but not robust; lack of null checks or imports shown. Overall easy to follow but minor syntax and behavior concerns.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Code is compact and uses a ternary to guard division by zero. However getSoma() and getContagem() return doubles? If they return integers, division may be integer division. Formatting lacks spaces but is readable. Minor risk about potential divide by zero avoided. Overall clear but small ambiguity about return types.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Codigo algo confuso: usa arrays de tamanho num.length()+1 e indices derivados; laco contagem complicada; possiveis NullPointer e ArrayIndexOutOfBounds; uso innecesario de Strings para numeros; legibilidade baixa e sem comentarios. Melhoraria com logica clara, nomes significativos e tratamento de casos especiais.","tokens":512,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has clear structure and reasonable naming, but uses Portuguese identifiers and mixed logic with possible null font handling. Some variables like FONTES, NOMES, and gera dorNomes not defined here reduce self containment. The loop and conditionals are straightforward, though readability could improve with constants for color alternation and clarifying canDisplayUpTo usage.","tokens":474,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"O método tem nomenclatura em Portugues e retorna um elemento de ENUMS calculado com ordinal. A expressão usa ordinal() / 3 * 3 para obter o primeiro mês do trimestre, presumindo ENUMS ser um array de Month. Falta contexto sobre ENUMS e o índice pode lançar excecao se array vazio. A legibilidade é moderada, mas a ligacao entre ordinal e trimestre não é clara sem mais código.","tokens":290,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method isCorrect and concise for leap year logic. However it could be simplified to return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 (ano % 100 !\u003d 0 || ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0)); The if else adds verbosity without additonal clarity","tokens":288,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is small and clear: computes circle area using PI constant and radius. Minor issues: PI could use Math.PI for accuracy, and method could be static in a class context; naming in Portuguese is fine. Overall readable but a few best practices slightly missing.","tokens":267,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Function name is descriptive in Portuguese; code computes area of isosceles triangle but formula uses base*altura/2 which is generic triangle area. Minor formatting and indentation could improve readability; missing class context and access modifiers but the snippet is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":267,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and readable but lacks null checks and type constraints. It mutates internal state by aggregating fields from another object; the use of sumWithCompensation twice is a bit cryptic without context. Overall straightforward arithmetic and min/max updates, but missing comments and defensive checks reduce clarity.","tokens":300,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Code is short but hard to read due to implicit casting and modular arithmetic. Casting long to int and using ordinal and ENUMS array without context reduces clarity. The method name plus and operations are not self explanatory, potential for negative months handling and enum bounds confusion. Overall readability is below average for maintainable code.","tokens":278,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
