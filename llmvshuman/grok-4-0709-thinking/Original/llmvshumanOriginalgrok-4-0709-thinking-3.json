{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with comprehensive Javadoc comments, meaningful method and variable names in Portuguese, inline comments explaining the formula, and simple, straightforward logic for calculating the triangle area, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1400,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with detailed Portuguese Javadoc explaining the purpose and examples clearly. The method implementation is concise and clever using ordinal division for quarter calculation, assuming ENUMS is a Month array. It\u0027s easy to comprehend for Java developers, though the math trick might require a brief pause to verify.","tokens":1504,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc and inline comments in Portuguese, matching the method\u0027s purpose. Variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 are intuitive. The logic is simple and well-structured, using a constant for PI. No unnecessary complexity, making it easy to comprehend for any Java developer.","tokens":1429,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return. Inline comment describes the logic accurately. Method name is descriptive in Portuguese. The if-else structure is explicit and easy to follow, though it could be simplified by directly returning the condition. Overall, very comprehensible.","tokens":1428,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with comprehensive Javadoc in Portuguese explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and behavior. The implementation is concise and clever, using modulo for wrapping around months, calling \u0027soma\u0027 with a negated value. Variable and method names are descriptive in Portuguese, aiding comprehension for speakers. Minor deduction for potential language barrier for non-Portuguese readers, but overall easy to understand.","tokens":1461,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc in Portuguese, meaningful variable names, and a concise implementation. The method logic is straightforward, updating statistics appropriately, and the inline comment clarifies the compensation subtraction. As a native Portuguese speaker, the documentation enhances comprehension without any confusion.","tokens":1477,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured, with a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese that clearly explains the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and behavior. The logic uses modulo operations effectively to handle month wrapping and negative values, making it efficient. However, the clever modulo trick for negatives might require a brief moment to fully grasp, slightly impacting immediate comprehension. Overall, it\u0027s highly readable for a Java developer familiar with enums.","tokens":1550,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is reasonably readable with meaningful Portuguese variable names like novoNo and indiceAleatorio, and helpful comments explaining the logic. The loop structure is clear, but mixed language elements (e.g., English class names) and conditional font checks add slight complexity. Overall, it\u0027s easy to follow for a Java developer familiar with Portuguese, though international readability could be improved.","tokens":1785,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear ternary operator for the average calculation. Javadoc is detailed and in Portuguese, matching the method name getMedia, which aids comprehension for Portuguese speakers. Logic is straightforward: return sum/count if count \u003e 0, else 0. Cross-references to getSoma enhance understanding. Minor deduction for non-English names potentially reducing accessibility for international developers.","tokens":1559,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese explaining the algorithm with an example, which aids understanding. However, the implementation uses an array of strings for calculations, leading to unnecessary string manipulations and digit splitting, which complicates readability. Loop indices are tricky, starting from the end and using an extra array slot, potentially causing confusion. Variable names mix Portuguese and English. A more straightforward approach with integer operations would improve comprehension.","tokens":2400,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
