{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return. Method name is descriptive in Portuguese. Inline comment clarifies the leap year rule. Logic is straightforward and explicit with if-else, making it easy to comprehend. No unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1281,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc and inline comments in Portuguese, matching the method\u0027s purpose. Variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 are descriptive and consistent. The structure is simple, using a constant for PI and straightforward calculation, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1389,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments in Portuguese explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, and notes. The logic uses a simple ternary operator for the average calculation, making it easy to comprehend. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are consistent and descriptive. Minor deduction for potential language barrier if not all readers know Portuguese, but overall excellent for a Portuguese-speaking evaluator.","tokens":1438,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and return value. Method and variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, matching the native speaker context. Inline comments detail the formula and return statement. The logic is simple and straightforward, making it easy to comprehend even for non-Portuguese speakers due to the universal math formula.","tokens":1427,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a detailed Portuguese comment explaining the purpose clearly. The method name is descriptive and matches the comment. The implementation is concise and clever using ordinal division to find the quarter\u0027s first month, assuming ENUMS is an array of Month enums. It\u0027s easy to comprehend for Java developers familiar with enums. Minor deduction for potential assumption on ENUMS array.","tokens":1498,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured, with clear Javadoc comments in Portuguese that explain the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and behavior. The implementation uses efficient modulo arithmetic to handle month wrapping and negative values correctly. It assumes a standard enum setup with ENUMS array and ordinal(), which is idiomatic in Java. The logic is clever but straightforward for experienced developers, making it easy to comprehend. Minor deduction for potential unfamiliarity with Portuguese docs for non-speakers, though irrelevant for the evaluator.","tokens":1646,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with comprehensive Javadoc in Portuguese, matching the assistant\u0027s native language. The method is concise, using meaningful names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027. Logic is clever with modulo for wrapping, easy to comprehend for Java experts, though the negative modulo might require brief thought. Overall, excellent clarity and structure.","tokens":1540,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is reasonably readable with meaningful Portuguese variable names like novoNo and indiceAleatorio, aiding comprehension for Portuguese speakers. The logic for generating random child nodes with fonts and colors is clear, but mixed English-Portuguese elements and complex font checks slightly hinder overall ease. Comments help, though some indentation is inconsistent.","tokens":1769,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a concise structure. The Javadoc and inline comment in Portuguese are appropriate and explanatory, aiding comprehension for Portuguese speakers. The logic for combining statistics, including summation compensation, is straightforward and easy to follow, assuming familiarity with Java\u0027s statistical utilities. Minor deduction for potential confusion in non-Portuguese readers, but overall excellent.","tokens":1647,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is somewhat readable due to the detailed Javadoc comment explaining the algorithm with an example. However, using a String array for digit manipulations and the convoluted looping with offset indices make it harder to comprehend. Unnecessary complexity with strings instead of direct integer operations reduces ease of understanding. Potential issue if soma%10\u003d\u003d0 returns 10 instead of 0, but focusing on readability, its moderate.","tokens":2913,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
