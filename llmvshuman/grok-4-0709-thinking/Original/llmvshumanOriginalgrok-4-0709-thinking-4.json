Logic is straightforward, with an inline comment clarifying the leap year rule. Structure is simple and explicit, making it easy to comprehend quickly.","tokens":1288,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return. Method name is descriptive in Portuguese. Inline comments detail the formula and return statement. Variable names are meaningful. The logic is simple and straightforward, making it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1400,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc documentation, inline comments explaining each step, meaningful variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027, and simple, straightforward logic. It\u0027s easy to understand at a glance, even for non-native Portuguese speakers familiar with Java.","tokens":1386,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a concise ternary operator that clearly computes the average or returns zero. The Javadoc comment is detailed, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, potential numerical variations, and best practices for accuracy. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are intuitive in Portuguese, matching the comment language. Overall, it\u0027s easy to comprehend for Java developers, though the Portuguese might slightly limit accessibility for non-speakers.","tokens":1495,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear Javadoc in Portuguese explaining the method\u0027s purpose, including handling of negative values and immutability. The implementation is concise, using modular arithmetic to handle month wrapping efficiently. The logic with (amount + 12) % 12 correctly manages negative inputs. Assumes ENUMS array and ordinal() are properly set up, which is standard for enums. Minor density in the expression, but overall easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":1611,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code snippet is highly readable with comprehensive Javadoc comments in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, and immutability. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is intuitive for subtracting months. The implementation is concise and clever, reusing \u0027soma\u0027 with modulo for wrap-around, making it easy to comprehend. Minor deduction as non-Portuguese speakers might need translation.","tokens":1632,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise with clear, detailed Javadoc in Portuguese explaining the quarter logic and examples. The code uses enum ordinal for efficient calculation, making it easy to comprehend for Java developers familiar with enums. High readability overall, though language may limit non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":1605,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear Javadoc in Portuguese explaining the purpose and parameters. Variable names are meaningful, and the logic is straightforward: updating count, sums, min, and max. The use of Math.min/max is intuitive. Slight deduction for the custom sumWithCompensation method, which may require context, but overall easy to comprehend.","tokens":1590,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with meaningful Portuguese variable names and comments that explain the purpose and caveats effectively. Logic for generating random child nodes with fonts and colors is clear and easy to follow. Minor issues include slight indentation inconsistency on the insert line and potential confusion for non-Portuguese readers, but overall comprehension is high for Java developers.","tokens":1820,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code includes a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese that explains the algorithm with an example, aiding comprehension. However, the implementation relies on inefficient string manipulations and an oversized array, with loops that could be simplified using integer operations. Variable names are descriptive but the logic flow is convoluted, potentially leading to off-by-one errors. There might be a bug in DV calculation when soma % 10 \u003d\u003d 0, as it returns 10 instead of 0. Overall, moderate readability for a Java expert.","tokens":3184,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
