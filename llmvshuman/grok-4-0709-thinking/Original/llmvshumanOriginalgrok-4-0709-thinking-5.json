{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with comprehensive Javadoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return value. The method name is descriptive, and the logic is simple and well-structured with an inline comment clarifying the leap year rule. No unnecessary complexity, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1344,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc documentation, inline comments explaining each step, meaningful variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027, and simple, straightforward logic. It\u0027s easy to understand at a glance, even for non-native Portuguese speakers familiar with Java.","tokens":1386,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented with a clear Javadoc in Portuguese, matching the assistant\u0027s native language. The method uses standard modulo arithmetic for month wrapping, which is efficient but slightly tricky due to handling negatives. Assumes familiarity with enum ordinals and ENUMS array, making it easy to comprehend for experienced Java developers, though the non-English comments might limit accessibility.","tokens":1545,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese explaining the purpose and examples clearly. The method name is descriptive, and the logic is concise using enum ordinal for quarter calculation. Assumes ENUMS array exists, which is standard for enums, making it easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":1499,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and return value. Method and variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, matching the context. Inline comments describe the formula and return statement. The logic is simple and straightforward, making it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1572,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with detailed Javadoc in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and immutability. Method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027 are intuitive for Portuguese speakers. The implementation is concise, using modular arithmetic for month wrapping, which is efficient and easy to understand with basic math knowledge. Minor deduction for assuming \u0027soma\u0027 handles negatives correctly without inline explanation.","tokens":1675,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear method naming and structure. Javadoc in Portuguese is detailed and matches the assistant\u0027s native language, aiding comprehension. Variable names are intuitive, and the logic for combining statistics is straightforward, including numerical stability via sumWithCompensation. Minor deduction for potential language barrier for non-Portuguese speakers, but overall easy to understand.","tokens":1553,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese that clearly explains the methods purpose, behavior, and notes on precision. The implementation is concise and straightforward using a ternary operator for the average calculation, with descriptive method names like getSoma and getContagem enhancing comprehension.","tokens":1655,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is structured with a clear loop for generating child nodes using random names, fonts, and alternating colors. Portuguese variable names and comments may hinder comprehension for non-Portuguese speakers, but the logic is straightforward. Minor issues include magic numbers and a specific warning about using add() vs insert(), which adds clarity. Overall, it\u0027s readable but could benefit from English identifiers for broader accessibility.","tokens":1858,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has a detailed Javadoc comment that explains the algorithm well with an example, aiding comprehension. However, the implementation is convoluted, using an array of strings for calculations instead of integers, which makes it less readable. Loops with tricky indexing and unnecessary string manipulations complicate understanding. Variable names in Portuguese are appropriate but the overall structure could be simplified for better ease of comprehension.","tokens":2621,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
