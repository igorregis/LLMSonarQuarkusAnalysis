{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return. Inline comment describes the logic accurately. The method name is descriptive in Portuguese, matching the context. The if-else structure is simple and explicit, making it easy to comprehend the leap year check.","tokens":1356,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc and inline comments in Portuguese, matching the method\u0027s purpose. Variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 are intuitive. The logic is straightforward, using a constant for PI and a simple formula, making it easy to comprehend even for beginners.","tokens":1357,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with comprehensive Javadoc comments, meaningful variable and method names in Portuguese, inline comments explaining the formula, and straightforward logic for calculating the triangle area. It is easy to understand at a glance.","tokens":1414,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear Javadoc in Portuguese, meaningful variable names, and concise logic. It combines statistics accurately using summation compensation. Minor assumption of familiarity with sumWithCompensation method, but overall easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":1457,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses standard modulo arithmetic for month wrapping, making it efficient. The Javadoc is clear and descriptive, though in Portuguese, which may limit accessibility for non-speakers. The logic with (amount + 12) % 12 handles negatives well but could benefit from an inline comment for immediate clarity. Overall, easy to comprehend for experienced Java developers.","tokens":1478,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese that clearly explains the methods purpose and behavior. The implementation is concise using a ternary operator for average calculation, with descriptive method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem, ensuring easy comprehension.","tokens":1502,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with detailed Portuguese Javadoc explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and behavior. The implementation is concise, cleverly reusing \u0027soma\u0027 for subtraction via negative modulo 12 to handle year wrapping. Assumes \u0027soma\u0027 is defined elsewhere, but logic is straightforward for experienced Java developers.","tokens":1740,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with clear structure and comments in Portuguese. Variable names like novoNo and indiceAleatorio are descriptive but mixing languages may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. Logic for font checking and node creation is straightforward, though the inline comment about add() vs insert() adds useful context. Minor indentation issue on insert line. Overall easy to comprehend for Java developers familiar with the language.","tokens":1784,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with comprehensive Javadoc in Portuguese explaining the purpose and examples clearly. The method name is descriptive, and the implementation is concise using integer division on ordinal() to compute the quarter\u0027s first month. Assumes ENUMS is properly defined, but overall easy to comprehend for Java developers. Minor deduction for relying on enum knowledge.","tokens":1708,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional and includes a detailed Javadoc comment with an example, aiding understanding. However, readability is hampered by unnecessary string conversions, an oversized array with unused index, convoluted loop structures, and lack of clear variable naming or error handling. It could be simplified using char operations instead of substrings for better comprehension.","tokens":2686,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
