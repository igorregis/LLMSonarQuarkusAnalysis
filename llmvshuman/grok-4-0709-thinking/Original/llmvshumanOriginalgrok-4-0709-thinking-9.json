{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear Javadoc comment in Portuguese explaining the method\u0027s purpose, including notes on precision. The implementation uses a simple ternary operator for conciseness, making it easy to comprehend. Method names like getMedia, getContagem, and getSoma are descriptive and consistent with Portuguese naming. Overall, it\u0027s straightforward and well-structured, though the ternary could be expanded for even better clarity in complex scenarios.","tokens":1545,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, well-structured, and uses standard Java enum features like ordinal() and an ENUMS array. The Javadoc comment is detailed and in Portuguese, which is accessible given the context. The modulo logic efficiently handles positive and negative month additions with wrap-around, enhancing readability and comprehension for experienced developers.","tokens":1535,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear variable names and a concise structure. The Javadoc in Portuguese accurately describes the method\u0027s purpose and exceptions. The inline comment explains the compensation subtraction. The logic for combining statistics is straightforward, using standard Math functions for min and max. Minor deduction due to assumed knowledge of sumWithCompensation method, but overall easy to comprehend for Java developers.","tokens":1476,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a detailed Javadoc comment in Portuguese explaining the purpose and examples clearly. The method implementation is concise and clever, using enum ordinal for quarter calculation, making it easy to comprehend for experienced developers.","tokens":1517,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code has a detailed Javadoc comment with an example, which aids understanding. However, it uses unnecessary string manipulations and array operations for digit summing, making it convoluted. Loops with reverse indexing and multiple parsing steps reduce readability. A simpler mathematical approach would improve comprehension.","tokens":2142,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with detailed Javadoc in Portuguese explaining purpose, behavior, and parameters. Method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is clear, and the implementation is concise, cleverly reusing \u0027soma\u0027 with modulo for wrapping. Assumes familiarity with the class, but overall easy to comprehend.","tokens":1550,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with clear structure and Portuguese comments that explain the purpose. Variable names like novoNo and indiceAleatorio are descriptive in Portuguese, aiding comprehension for speakers. Logic for font checking and color alternation is straightforward, but the inline comment about not using add() adds useful context. Minor issues include inconsistent indentation on the insert line and magic numbers, which slightly reduce ease of understanding. Overall, easy to follow for Java developers familiar with the language.","tokens":1843,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
