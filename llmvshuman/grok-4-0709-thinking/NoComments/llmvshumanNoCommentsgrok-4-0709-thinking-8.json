{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and correctly checks for leap years using standard logic. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is appropriate in Portuguese. Structure is straightforward with proper indentation. It could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression, but it\u0027s still easy to comprehend.","tokens":1322,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names like count, min, and max, making the intent easy to understand. It performs straightforward operations to combine statistics. The method calls to sumWithCompensation are logical in context, though assuming prior knowledge of the method. No complex logic or redundancy. Lacks comments, but the simplicity ensures high readability and comprehension.","tokens":1378,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear, descriptive method name in Portuguese (\u0027calcularAreaTrianguloIsosceles\u0027), meaningful parameter names (\u0027base\u0027 and \u0027altura\u0027), and simple arithmetic logic for triangle area calculation. Proper formatting and no unnecessary complexity make it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1294,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese (\u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 meaning calculate circle area), descriptive variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 (radius) and \u0027area\u0027, a constant for PI, and a simple, straightforward calculation without unnecessary complexity. It\u0027s easy to comprehend at a glance.","tokens":1289,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for clarity in handling division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getContagem, and getSoma are descriptive in Portuguese, aligning with the class context. It\u0027s easy to comprehend for Java developers, though an if-else might enhance readability for beginners. Overall, highly readable with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1310,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise, using modulo to handle month addition with wrapping, including negative values via (amount + 12). It\u0027s efficient for Java enums but the nested expression may require brief analysis for full understanding, making it readable yet not instantly intuitive.","tokens":1469,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses Portuguese names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is concise but cryptic, subtracting months via negative modulo without comments or error handling. Missing semicolon in return statement. Overall, it\u0027s functional but hard to comprehend quickly.","tokens":1349,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a clear loop for creating child nodes. Variable names in Portuguese are meaningful and consistent, aiding comprehension for Portuguese speakers. Logic for font selection and color alternation is straightforward, though it relies on external class fields like NOMES and fontes. Minor density in the font check condition, but overall easy to follow with basic Java knowledge.","tokens":1849,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses integer division to compute the first month of the quarter based on enum ordinal, which is clever and efficient. Readability is good for those familiar with Java enums, but the logic with magic number 3 could benefit from a comment for quicker comprehension. Method name in Portuguese is clear in context but may confuse non-speakers. Overall, easy to understand with minimal effort.","tokens":1705,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code calculates a check digit but suffers from poor readability: unnecessary string array for storage, frequent type conversions, confusing loop indices (e.g., array size +1 with unused slot 0), and potential for errors without input validation. Logic is convoluted, lacks comments, and uses verbose substring operations for digit summing.","tokens":2619,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
