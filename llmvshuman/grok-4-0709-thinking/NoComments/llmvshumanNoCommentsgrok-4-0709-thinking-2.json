{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable and easy to comprehend. The method name clearly describes its purpose in Portuguese, parameters are intuitively named (base and altura), and the logic is straightforward with a simple formula. No unnecessary complexity, making it instantly understandable for any Java developer.","tokens":1361,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, using a ternary operator for a clear average calculation, avoiding division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are descriptive in Portuguese, fitting the context. It\u0027s easy to understand for Java developers, with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1344,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names like count, min, and max, making it easy to follow. The operations are straightforward, with simple additions and Math functions. The sumWithCompensation method calls are clear in intent for accurate summation, though slight familiarity with the class helps. Overall, highly readable for Java developers.","tokens":1422,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and correctly checks for leap years using standard logic. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is clear in Portuguese context. Indentation is proper, making it easy to read. It could be more concise by returning the condition directly instead of using if-else, but this does not significantly impact comprehension.","tokens":1464,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear, descriptive method name in Portuguese (\u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 meaning \u0027calculateCircleArea\u0027) and variable \u0027raio\u0027 (radius). It uses a constant for PI and a simple formula for area calculation. The structure is straightforward, making it easy to comprehend for Java developers, especially Portuguese speakers. No unnecessary complexity or clutter.","tokens":1392,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has low readability due to non-English method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, which may confuse non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is overly concise and potentially incorrect for month subtraction (e.g., doesn\u0027t handle full years properly). Missing semicolon causes syntax error. No comments or context provided, making comprehension difficult.","tokens":1430,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a clear loop for creating child nodes, using descriptive Portuguese variable names that align with the method\u0027s purpose. Logic for random name selection, font handling, and color alternation is straightforward and easy to follow, though English comments could enhance accessibility for non-Portuguese speakers. No major obfuscations or complexities.","tokens":1743,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and correctly handles modular arithmetic for adding months, including negative values, using a common idiom. However, the dense expression with nested operations and lack of comments may require extra effort to comprehend fully, reducing readability for less experienced developers.","tokens":1599,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise with a clear name in Portuguese meaning first month of the quarter. It uses integer division on ordinal to compute the quarters start index in ENUMS array, a common idiom. Readable for Java devs, but relies on context for ENUMS and enum ordinals.","tokens":1640,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is hard to read due to convoluted loop structures with unusual indexing (e.g., leaving array[0] null and accessing in reverse), excessive string conversions for basic arithmetic, and lack of comments or descriptive variable names. It could be simplified using integer arrays, reducing comprehension effort.","tokens":2271,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
