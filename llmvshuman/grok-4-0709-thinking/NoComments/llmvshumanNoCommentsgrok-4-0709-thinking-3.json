{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, descriptive parameters (base and altura), and a straightforward calculation of the triangle area using the standard formula. No unnecessary complexity, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1317,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is exceptionally readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, meaningful variables like raio and area, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. Its simplicity ensures easy comprehension for any Java developer.","tokens":1380,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and correctly checks for leap years using standard logic. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is meaningful in Portuguese. Indentation is proper, and the structure is straightforward. It could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression, but it\u0027s still very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1327,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable and easy to comprehend. It uses a simple ternary operator to compute the average, avoiding division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are clear and descriptive in Portuguese, fitting the context. The logic is straightforward with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1363,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names like count, min, and max, making it easy to follow. Operations are straightforward with standard Math methods. However, the sumWithCompensation calls might be unclear without class context or comments, slightly reducing comprehension for unfamiliar readers.","tokens":1351,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and functional, implementing month addition with modulo arithmetic to handle wrapping and negative values. However, the nested expressions and double modulo operation make it somewhat dense, requiring careful parsing to understand the intent, especially for handling negative months. It could be clearer with intermediate variables or comments, but as a snippet, it\u0027s moderately readable for experienced developers.","tokens":1500,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity. Method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is in Portuguese, potentially confusing non-speakers. Logic uses modulo and negation for subtraction, which is clever but not immediately intuitive without context. No comments, error handling, or semicolon (possibly snippet error). Assumes \u0027soma\u0027 method exists and handles wrapping correctly, reducing readability.","tokens":1448,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise, using integer division on ordinal to compute the first month of the quarter via an ENUMS array. It\u0027s clever and efficient, easy for experienced Java devs to grasp, but lacks comments or variables for clarity, which could hinder beginners.","tokens":1392,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with a clear loop structure for creating child nodes. Variable names in Portuguese like novoNo and indiceAleatorio are descriptive for Portuguese speakers but may confuse others. Logic for font selection and color alternation is straightforward though the if-else for fonte could be simplified. Undefined external references like NOMES and fontes reduce comprehension without context. Overall easy to follow for Java developers familiar with the language.","tokens":1725,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to confusing loop directions, unnecessary use of a String array for numeric operations, and excessive String-int conversions. Variable names like numeros are not descriptive, and the logic for digit summing is convoluted without comments, making comprehension difficult.","tokens":2184,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
