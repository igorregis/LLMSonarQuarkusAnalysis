{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise with descriptive variable names and simple operations for combining statistics. It updates counts, sums, applies compensation, and adjusts min/max clearly. High readability, though lacks comments on sumWithCompensation for full context.","tokens":1329,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and the called method \u0027soma\u0027 are in Portuguese, which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic uses a clever but opaque trick with negation and modulo, making the intent unclear without context. No comments or descriptive naming hinder comprehension. Overall, it\u0027s concise but not easy to understand at a glance.","tokens":1386,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, meaningful variables, and simple logic for calculating circle area. Using final for PI is a good practice, and the structure is straightforward, making it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1335,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and correctly checks for leap years using standard rules. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is clear in Portuguese. Logic is easy to follow with proper indentation. It could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression, but it\u0027s still highly readable and comprehensible.","tokens":1317,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable with a descriptive method name in Portuguese, clear parameter names (base and altura), and simple arithmetic logic. The variable \u0027area\u0027 is straightforward, and the structure is clean, making it easy to comprehend at a glance.","tokens":1290,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear ternary operator to compute the average, avoiding division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are descriptive in Portuguese, aligning with the context. It\u0027s easy to comprehend at a glance, though an explicit if-else might slightly improve readability for some.","tokens":1324,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses standard Java enum features like ordinal() and modulo for wrapping months. Variable naming is clear, but the expression with (amount + 12) % 12 might require a brief mental note for handling negatives, reducing immediate comprehension slightly. Overall, easy for experienced developers.","tokens":1433,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses enum ordinal with integer division to find the first month of the quarter, which is clever and efficient. Readability is good for experienced developers familiar with enums, but could benefit from a comment explaining the logic for clarity. No syntax issues, easy to comprehend overall.","tokens":1348,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with meaningful Portuguese variable names like novoNo and indiceAleatorio, which align with the method\u0027s purpose of loading child nodes. The loop structure is clear, and logic for font selection and color alternation is straightforward. However, it lacks comments, and the font check condition could be clearer. Assumes familiarity with external constants like NOMES and fontes, which might reduce comprehension without context. Overall, easy to follow for a Java developer.","tokens":1639,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code implements a check digit calculation similar to Luhn but is hard to read due to confusing loop structures, excessive string manipulations, and array indexing that risks off-by-one errors. Variable names like \u0027numeros\u0027 are vague, and there\u0027s no clear separation of concerns, making comprehension difficult without stepping through it.","tokens":2321,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
