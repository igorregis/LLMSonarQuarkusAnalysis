{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, descriptive parameters (base and altura), and simple arithmetic for triangle area calculation. No unnecessary complexity, making it easy to comprehend instantly.","tokens":1284,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear method naming in Portuguese (isAnoBissexto means isLeapYear), standard leap year logic, and proper indentation. It\u0027s easy to comprehend at a glance, though it could be simplified by directly returning the condition instead of using if-else for true/false.","tokens":1328,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise with meaningful variable names like count, min, and max. Operations are straightforward, using standard Math functions, making the combining logic easy to follow. The sumWithCompensation calls are logical for numerical stability, though a comment could clarify this. Overall, highly readable for Java developers.","tokens":1348,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with a clear method name and parameter in Portuguese, matching the function\u0027s purpose. It uses a constant for PI and a simple calculation, making it easy to understand. Minor deduction for not using Math.PI for better precision and standard practice.","tokens":1355,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, using a ternary operator to safely compute an average, preventing division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are clear and descriptive in Portuguese, fitting the context. It\u0027s straightforward and easy to understand quickly, with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1322,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses enum ordinal with integer division to find the first month of the quarter, which is clever and efficient. It\u0027s readable for experienced Java developers familiar with enums, but could benefit from a comment explaining the logic for better comprehension. The Portuguese method name is clear in context, assuming the codebase uses it consistently.","tokens":1408,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear loop logic for creating tree nodes. Variable names in Portuguese are descriptive and consistent, aiding comprehension for Portuguese speakers. Font and color assignment logic is straightforward, though the font check could be simplified. Overall, easy to follow with no major obfuscations, but lacks comments for better clarity.","tokens":1610,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is in Portuguese, which may hinder readability for non-speakers. The logic using soma with negative modulo is concise but cryptic without context on month wrapping. Missing semicolon after return statement makes it invalid Java, reducing comprehension. Overall, it\u0027s brief but not easy to understand at a glance.","tokens":1574,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise, using enum ordinal and modulo for month addition, cleverly handling negatives with (amount + 12) % 12. It\u0027s efficient and correct, but the nested expressions might require a brief pause to fully grasp, especially for less experienced developers. Assumes ENUMS is a standard values() array. Readable for seniors.","tokens":1606,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks readability due to poor variable naming (e.g., numeros as String array), unnecessary string conversions, convoluted loop structures with magic indices, and unused array slot. No comments explain the logic, making comprehension difficult without deep analysis. It could be simplified with integer arrays and clearer iterations.","tokens":2109,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
