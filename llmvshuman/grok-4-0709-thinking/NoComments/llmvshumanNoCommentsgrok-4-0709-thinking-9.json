{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear method naming in Portuguese, proper indentation, and straightforward logic for leap year check. It could be simplified by directly returning the condition, but it\u0027s easy to comprehend overall.","tokens":1336,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese that matches its purpose, descriptive parameter names (base and altura), and a simple calculation. The logic is straightforward, making it easy to comprehend at a glance with no unnecessary complexity or ambiguity.","tokens":1348,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, meaningful variable names like raio and area, a constant for PI, and simple calculation logic. It\u0027s concise and easy to understand at a glance, ideal for comprehension.","tokens":1316,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses enum ordinal with integer division to find the first month of the quarter, assuming ENUMS is a static array of months. It\u0027s readable for experienced Java developers familiar with enums, but could benefit from a comment explaining the logic for better comprehension. The Portuguese method name is clear in context, enhancing readability without unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1357,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and functional, handling month addition with modulo arithmetic to wrap around. However, the dense expression with nested operations and handling for negative values may require careful reading to comprehend fully. Better variable names or comments could improve readability.","tokens":1377,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise with clear variable names like count, min, and max. It performs straightforward updates using standard Math methods and a presumed class method sumWithCompensation. Assumes familiarity with the class context for full comprehension, but the logic is simple and easy to follow without unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1379,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and easy to understand, using a ternary operator to safely compute the average while avoiding division by zero. Portuguese method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are clear and appropriate given the evaluator\u0027s native language. The logic is straightforward with no unnecessary complexity, making it highly readable.","tokens":1379,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a clear loop for creating and inserting tree nodes. Variable names in Portuguese are consistent and meaningful for Portuguese speakers, enhancing readability. Logic for font selection and color alternation is straightforward, though it assumes familiarity with external constants like NOMES and fontes. Minor improvements could include comments for complex conditions, but overall comprehension is easy for experienced Java developers.","tokens":1617,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses Portuguese names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027meses\u0027, which reduces readability for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is terse: subtracting months by adding negative modulo 12, but it may not handle full years correctly and lacks comments. Possible missing semicolon in return statement. Concise but hard to comprehend without context.","tokens":1637,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code employs convoluted loop structures, starting indices from the end and using a String array for numeric values, which involves unnecessary conversions and substrings. Variable names like numeros are vague, and the logic for digit summing is obscured without comments, reducing overall readability and ease of comprehension.","tokens":2222,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
