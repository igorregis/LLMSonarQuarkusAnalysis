{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a descriptive method name in Portuguese, clear parameter names (base and altura), and simple arithmetic for triangle area calculation. No unnecessary complexity, making it very easy to comprehend.","tokens":1237,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear method name in Portuguese, meaningful variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. It\u0027s simple and easy to comprehend, making it perfect for maintenance.","tokens":1250,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names like count, min, and max, making the intent clear. Operations are straightforward, such as updating sums and extremes. The use of sumWithCompensation suggests precision handling, which is logical in context. Lacks comments, but overall easy to comprehend for Java developers familiar with statistics classes.","tokens":1335,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with proper indentation and a clear method name in Portuguese isAnoBissexto meaning isLeapYear. It correctly implements leap year logic using modulo operations. The if-else structure is straightforward but could be simplified by directly returning the condition for even better conciseness. Overall very easy to comprehend with no unnecessary complexity.","tokens":1439,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise, using a ternary operator to compute the average safely avoiding division by zero. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are intuitive in Portuguese, aligning with the context. Overall, it\u0027s straightforward and easy to comprehend, though ternary might be slightly less readable for absolute beginners than an if-else structure.","tokens":1413,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses enum ordinal for quarter calculation, which is clever but requires understanding of integer division. It\u0027s easy to comprehend for experienced Java developers, though a comment could enhance clarity. Assumes ENUMS is Month.values().","tokens":1430,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses standard Java enum features like ordinal(). It handles modular arithmetic for adding months, including negatives, via a clever but somewhat dense expression with (amount + 12) % 12. This might confuse readers unfamiliar with Java\u0027s negative modulo behavior, reducing immediate comprehension. Variable naming is adequate, but lacks comments for clarity. Overall, it\u0027s readable for experienced developers.","tokens":1836,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code snippet has readability issues: method and parameter names are in Portuguese (subtrai, meses, soma), which reduces accessibility for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic is cryptic, using negation and modulo for subtraction without explanation. Missing semicolon after the return statement makes it invalid Java, hindering comprehension. It\u0027s concise but not easy to understand at a glance.","tokens":1685,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with logical structure and meaningful variable names in Portuguese, which aligns with the native speaker context. However, mixed language elements and slightly convoluted font assignment logic reduce ease of comprehension for non-Portuguese readers. No comments present, but the flow is straightforward for a tree node loading method.","tokens":1942,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has confusing loop directions and array indexing, with an unnecessary extra array slot left null. It relies heavily on string manipulations for numeric operations, which is inefficient and obscures the intent. Lack of comments and unclear variable usage reduce readability, though the purpose as a check digit calculator is inferable.","tokens":2237,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
