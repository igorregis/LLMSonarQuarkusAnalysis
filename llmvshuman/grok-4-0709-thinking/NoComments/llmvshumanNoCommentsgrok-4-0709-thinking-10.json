{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and correctly checks for leap years using standard logic. The method name \u0027isAnoBissexto\u0027 is appropriate in Portuguese. Structure is straightforward with proper indentation. It could be more concise by directly returning the boolean expression, but it\u0027s still easy to comprehend.","tokens":1322,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses enum ordinal for quarter calculation, which is efficient. However, it relies on an external ENUMS array and magic number 3, which might confuse without context. Overall, easy to comprehend for experienced Java devs but could benefit from a comment.","tokens":1283,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is extremely readable and easy to comprehend. It uses clear, descriptive method and variable names in Portuguese, which align with the assistant\u0027s native language. The logic is straightforward, implementing the basic triangle area formula without any complexity or unnecessary elements. No issues with formatting or structure.","tokens":1371,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names like count, min, and max, making it easy to follow. The method combines statistics logically with standard Math functions. It lacks comments, but the operations are straightforward for Java developers familiar with summary statistics. Minor deduction for assuming knowledge of sumWithCompensation method.","tokens":1281,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable and concise, using a ternary operator to handle division by zero safely. Method names like getMedia, getSoma, and getContagem are intuitive, especially in Portuguese context, clearly computing an average. No unnecessary complexity, making it easy to comprehend quickly.","tokens":1377,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and effectively handles month addition with modulo operations for wrapping, including negative values via (amount + 12) % 12. It\u0027s clever but requires a moment to parse the arithmetic. Variable names are clear, but no comments slightly hinder immediate comprehension for non-experts. Overall, highly readable for experienced Java developers.","tokens":1534,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with a clear structure and meaningful names in Portuguese, making it easy to comprehend the circle area calculation. It uses a constant for PI and straightforward computation. Slight deduction for not using Math.PI for better precision and standard practice.","tokens":1372,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a clear loop for creating tree nodes. Variable names in Portuguese are descriptive for speakers of the language, aiding comprehension. Logic for random selection, font handling, and color alternation is straightforward. Minor issues include lack of comments and reliance on external constants, but overall easy to follow for Java developers.","tokens":1591,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses Portuguese names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027, reducing readability for non-Portuguese speakers. The logic subtracts months by adding a negative modulo, which is clever but not immediately clear. Missing semicolon after return statement makes it invalid Java. Overall, it\u0027s terse and lacks context, hindering comprehension.","tokens":1452,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is functional but readability is low due to confusing loop structures, oversized array with unused elements, and excessive string-integer conversions. Index management is error-prone, and the logic for digit summing is convoluted. No comments and mixed naming conventions hinder quick comprehension.","tokens":2872,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
