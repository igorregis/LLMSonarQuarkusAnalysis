{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is simple and performs a basic calculation, likely the area of a triangle, but suffers from poor readability due to vague method name \u0027calc\u0027 and non-descriptive single-letter parameters \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027 and variable \u0027r\u0027. Lack of comments or context makes comprehension difficult without external knowledge.","tokens":1316,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with clear logic for checking leap years, but the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are poorly chosen and non-descriptive, making it harder to understand the purpose without context. The if-else structure is unnecessary and could be simplified to a direct return statement for better readability.","tokens":1410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical, non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which obscure its intent and make comprehension difficult. The logic is simple but lacks clarity without meaningful identifiers, reducing readability significantly.","tokens":1208,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward, calculating the area of a circle with clear structure. Variable names like P and a are somewhat descriptive but could be improved to PI and area for better clarity. Method name calc is vague; calculateArea would be preferable. No complex logic, making it easy to comprehend, though using Math.PI is recommended over hardcoding.","tokens":1357,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name tomilho is non-descriptive, seemingly a Portuguese word for thyme, which doesnt convey purpose. The variable pimentaCaiena, meaning cayenne pepper, is unclear without context, likely an array. The logic using ordinal divided by 3 multiplied by 3 might compute a quarter start, but its cryptic. Overall, poor readability due to obscure naming and lack of comments, making comprehension difficult.","tokens":1415,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs obscure Portuguese vegetable names as variables (e.g., abobora, inhame), obscuring intent and logic. Undefined elements like aspargos, aipo, MILHOS, and insert method hinder comprehension. Errors such as feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on an int variable add confusion. Structure is basic but overwhelmed by poor naming and inconsistencies, leading to low readability.","tokens":1820,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is syntactically correct and concise, using a ternary operator to avoid division by zero. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are nonsensical and not descriptive, severely hindering comprehension. In a real codebase, this would require context or comments to understand the intent, making it hard to read and maintain.","tokens":1506,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical variable names inspired by spices (e.g., menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena), which severely obscures its purpose and hampers readability. It seems to implement month addition modulo 12, possibly in a Month enum, but the lack of meaningful identifiers and comments makes comprehension difficult despite the simple logic.","tokens":1569,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs meaningless Portuguese vegetable names (e.g., batata, salsa, abobora) for variables and methods, severely hindering comprehension. It incorrectly accesses non-existent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, rendering it invalid Java. While the structure is basic, the obfuscated naming and misuse make it nearly impossible to understand without context.","tokens":1734,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to cryptic variable names like p, s, d, and lack of comments. It uses a String array for numeric values, leading to excessive String.valueOf and Integer.valueOf conversions, which complicates understanding. Loop indices are confusing, starting from p.length() and using reverse logic. The null check in the summing loop adds unnecessary complexity. Overall, it\u0027s hard to comprehend without deep analysis, resembling an obfuscated Luhn algorithm implementation.","tokens":2418,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
