{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, calculating what appears to be the area of a triangle. Variable names like \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, and \u0027r\u0027 are somewhat generic but clear in context. The method name \u0027calc\u0027 is vague, which slightly reduces readability. No unnecessary complexity, making it easy to comprehend overall.","tokens":1188,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and calculates the area of a circle using a hardcoded pi value. Readability is good due to straightforward logic and minimal lines. However, variable names like P and a could be more descriptive e.g., PI and area, and using Math.PI would improve accuracy and standard practice. Method name calc is vague; calculateArea would be better. Overall, easy to comprehend for basic understanding.","tokens":1344,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is cryptic and non-descriptive, possibly Portuguese for thyme, unrelated to apparent functionality. Variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) is equally obscure. Logic with ordinal()/3*3 suggests quarter start for months, but lacks clarity without context. Poor naming severely hampers readability and comprehension.","tokens":1375,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs obscure, non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which appear unrelated to functionality, possibly referencing spices in Portuguese. This obfuscation, combined with lack of comments and unclear logic involving modulo and negation, makes comprehension nearly impossible.","tokens":1305,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a ternary operator for conditional division, avoiding division by zero. However, readability is poor due to non-descriptive method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca, which resemble vegetable names in Portuguese and provide no context about their purpose, making comprehension difficult without additional documentation.","tokens":1323,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is cleanly structured with proper indentation and implements the leap year logic correctly. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and the parameter \u0027a\u0027 lacks descriptiveness, hindering comprehension. Simplifying to return the condition directly would improve readability.","tokens":1537,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs obscure, non-descriptive variable names like menta, nozMoscada, oregano, and pimentaCaiena, which appear to be spice-related terms, greatly hindering readability. The method\u0027s purpose is unclear without context, and the expression with modulo operations adds complexity, making overall comprehension poor despite the simple structure.","tokens":1472,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical vegetable-themed variable and method names in Portuguese (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata), which obscures intent and makes comprehension difficult. It accesses non-existent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, adding confusion. Structure is simple, but lack of meaningful names and comments results in very low readability.","tokens":1577,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical variable names based on Portuguese food terms (e.g., abobora, inhame, alcachofra), severely hindering comprehension of its logic and purpose. An evident error exists with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() called on an int variable. Undefined variables like aspargos and MILHOS add confusion. Readability is extremely poor, resembling obfuscated code rather than maintainable Java.","tokens":1834,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to cryptic variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and unclear logic with confusing array indexing. It uses strings for numeric operations unnecessarily, leading to excessive parsing. The loops are convoluted, making comprehension difficult without deep analysis, though it implements a check digit algorithm.","tokens":2330,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
