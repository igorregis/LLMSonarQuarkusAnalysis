{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and computes a simple formula, making it easy to comprehend at a glance. However, the method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too generic, and variables \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, and \u0027r\u0027 lack descriptiveness, reducing readability. Using meaningful names like \u0027base\u0027, \u0027height\u0027, and \u0027area\u0027 would enhance clarity without adding complexity.","tokens":1270,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code implements leap year logic correctly but suffers from poor naming: \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and \u0027a\u0027 should be \u0027year\u0027. The if-else structure is redundant and could be simplified to return the condition directly. Indentation is fine, making the logic easy to follow, but overall comprehension is hindered by vague identifiers.","tokens":1340,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward, calculating the area of a circle with a simple formula. Variable names P and a are intuitive but could be more explicit like PI and area for better clarity. Hardcoded pi value is acceptable but using Math.PI is preferable. No comments, but the logic is easy to follow overall.","tokens":1380,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, which appear to be spice names and do not convey any meaningful intent, making it extremely difficult to comprehend the purpose. The logic involves modulo operations and ordinal(), suggesting month manipulation, but the obfuscated naming severely hampers readability and ease of understanding.","tokens":1405,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are nonsensical and unrelated to the code\u0027s likely purpose, possibly quarter-start calculation for months, severely hindering readability and comprehension despite the simple arithmetic logic.","tokens":1430,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical, non-descriptive names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, which appear to be Portuguese words for spices, making the purpose and logic completely opaque. Despite simple syntax, comprehension is severely hindered by poor naming conventions, rendering it unreadable for maintenance or understanding.","tokens":1363,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to nonsensical variable names like abobora, inhame, and alcachofra, which are Portuguese words for vegetables, making intent unclear. There are undefined variables (e.g., aspargos, aipo, MILHOS) and a likely error (feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on an int). Logic is hard to follow without context, though basic structure is a loop creating nodes.","tokens":1749,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is syntactically simple with a clear ternary operator handling division by zero. However, method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are nonsensical and not descriptive, severely hindering comprehension of the methods purpose. This poor naming choice makes the code hard to understand at a glance, despite its brevity.","tokens":1456,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs absurd, non-descriptive variable names like \u0027gengibre\u0027, \u0027pimenta\u0027, and \u0027batata\u0027, which are Portuguese words for vegetables, rendering the logic incomprehensible. It misuses DoubleSummaryStatistics by treating methods as fields, lacks comments, and provides no context, severely impacting readability and ease of understanding.","tokens":1601,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor variable names like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, making intent unclear. It uses inefficient string conversions and manipulations for digit processing, with odd array indexing leaving d[0] unused. Loops are convoluted, obscuring the Luhn algorithm logic, reducing readability and comprehension.","tokens":2288,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
