{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is non-descriptive and seems unrelated to its purpose, possibly meaning \u0027thyme\u0027 in Portuguese, which confuses intent. The array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) is equally obscure. The logic using ordinal() suggests enum context like months, computing a quarter start, but without context or proper naming, comprehension is very low. Syntax is correct, but readability suffers greatly from poor naming conventions.","tokens":1418,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is a simple ternary expression to avoid division by zero, which is structurally clear and concise. However, the method names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca) are nonsensical and unrelated to any apparent purpose, resembling vegetable names in Portuguese. This severely hampers readability and comprehension without additional context, as names should be descriptive for maintainability.","tokens":1371,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and well-structured, implementing leap year logic clearly. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive, which slightly hinders comprehension. It could be more concise by directly returning the condition instead of using if-else.","tokens":1479,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has a simple structure but uses nonsensical variable names like menta, nozMoscada, oregano, and pimentaCaiena, which appear to be Portuguese spice terms, making it extremely hard to comprehend the intent. Without context, it\u0027s unclear what the method does, despite being a likely month addition with modulo. Readability is poor due to obfuscation.","tokens":1428,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses obscure, non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which appear unrelated to the functionality. The logic involves a modulo operation and negation, but without context or standard naming, its purpose is unclear. Assumes menta is defined elsewhere, making the snippet hard to comprehend in isolation. Simple structure, but poor readability overall.","tokens":1406,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and performs a basic calculation, likely the area of a triangle, making it easy to follow mathematically. However, the method name calc is too generic and not descriptive. Parameter names b and a, and variable r lack meaning, which hinders quick comprehension without context. Better naming would enhance readability.","tokens":1425,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs highly obfuscated variable names in Portuguese (e.g., abobora, inhame, alcachofra) that resemble vegetable terms, providing no insight into their purpose or function. This makes comprehension extremely difficult, despite the straightforward loop and conditional structure. Potential errors like feijaoVerde.nextFloat() further confuse readability.","tokens":1726,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward, calculating the area of a circle with a simple formula. It is easy to comprehend due to its brevity. However, improvements could include using more descriptive variable names like PI instead of P and area instead of a, a more specific method name than calc, and Math.PI for better precision. Overall, highly readable but not optimal.","tokens":1506,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable and method names like \u0027gengibre\u0027, \u0027pimenta\u0027, \u0027batata\u0027, etc., which are Portuguese words for spices and vegetables, providing no context or meaning. This severely hampers readability and comprehension. It appears to manipulate statistics, but without meaningful names, it\u0027s hard to understand intent. Syntax is correct, but lack of comments and poor naming drop the score low.","tokens":1755,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to cryptic variable names like p, s, d, and no comments explaining the purpose. Loops use confusing indexing, such as starting from p.length() and decrementing, with indirect array access. String array for numeric values and substring manipulations for digit summing are inefficient and obscure the intent, making comprehension difficult without extensive analysis.","tokens":2233,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
