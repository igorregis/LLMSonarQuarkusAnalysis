{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs cryptic and nonsensical variable and method names like menta, nozMoscada, oregano, and pimentaCaiena, which appear to be spice-related terms in Portuguese, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose and logic at a glance. While the structure is simple, the poor naming severely impairs readability and comprehension, suggesting potential obfuscation.","tokens":1329,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and straightforward, performing a basic calculation likely for triangle area. Variable names \u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, and \u0027r\u0027 are somewhat generic but clear in context. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is vague, but the logic is easy to follow with no complexity or redundancy. Minor improvements in naming could enhance readability.","tokens":1247,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name tomilho is obscure and non-descriptive, seemingly unrelated to its function. Variable pimentaCaiena is also cryptic, likely an array but without context. The logic with ordinal divided by 3 and multiplied back uses magic numbers, making comprehension difficult without additional code or comments. Syntax is correct but readability is poor overall.","tokens":1404,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is straightforward, calculating the area of a circle with basic operations. However, variable names like \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive; \u0027PI\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027 would be better. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is vague. Hardcoded pi value should use Math.PI for clarity. No comments, but easy to comprehend overall.","tokens":1392,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code correctly checks for leap years but uses a vague method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027, reducing comprehension. The if-else structure is clear yet unnecessary; it could directly return the boolean expression for conciseness. Indentation is proper, making the logic easy to follow despite naming issues.","tokens":1458,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a clear ternary operator to avoid division by zero. However, the method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are non-descriptive and use Portuguese words for vegetables/fruits, making the intent unclear without context. This severely hampers readability and comprehension. The final keyword on the method is appropriate but doesnt aid understanding. Overall, its easy to parse but hard to grasp the purpose.","tokens":1461,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs obscure Portuguese vegetable names like gengibre, pimenta, batata for methods and variables, which are non-descriptive and hinder understanding of intent. It incorrectly treats DoubleSummaryStatistics as having public fields like batata or salsa, which it does not, suggesting compilation issues. Lack of comments and context makes comprehension very difficult.","tokens":1650,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical Portuguese food-related variable names like abobora, inhame, and alcachofra, which obscure meaning and hinder comprehension. Undefined variables such as aspargos, aipo, and MILHOS add confusion. A potential bug exists with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on an int type. Overall logic is basic but readability is severely compromised by poor naming conventions.","tokens":1791,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to cryptic variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and lack of comments. It uses a String array with unnecessary conversions between strings and integers, leading to convoluted logic. Index management in loops is confusing, processing from the end with odd increments. The algorithm (likely Luhn) could be implemented more clearly with direct integer operations, making comprehension difficult without deep analysis.","tokens":2259,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical method and variable names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which appear to be unrelated words possibly from Portuguese, making it extremely difficult to understand the purpose or logic. The operation -(alecrim % 12) is cryptic without context, assuming menta returns a Month enum. Syntax is correct, but readability is severely compromised by obfuscated naming, hindering comprehension.","tokens":1335,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
