{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is simple and performs a basic calculation, likely the area of a triangle, but suffers from poor readability due to vague method name calc and single-letter parameters b, a, and variable r. Lack of descriptive names and comments makes comprehension difficult without external context.","tokens":1323,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, which appear to be Portuguese spice terms, making it extremely difficult to understand the intent. The logic involves modular arithmetic for what seems like month manipulation, but without meaningful names, comprehension is poor. Structure is basic, but obfuscation lowers readability significantly.","tokens":1453,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 and array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 are non-descriptive, using Portuguese spice names unrelated to the code\u0027s likely purpose (possibly returning the first month of a quarter via ordinal calculation). This obfuscates intent, making comprehension difficult despite simple syntax.","tokens":1361,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical Portuguese food-related variable names like abobora, alhoPoro, inhame, which obscure meaning and make comprehension difficult. Apparent errors, such as calling nextFloat on an int variable feijaoVerde, and undefined variables like aspargos, aipo, MILHOS further reduce readability. Logic is unclear due to poor naming and lack of context, making it hard to follow.","tokens":1759,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical method and variable names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, which provide no indication of purpose or functionality. It appears to perform a modulo operation and negation, but without context or proper naming, comprehension is extremely difficult. The snippet is short but highly obfuscated, making it unreadable for maintenance or understanding.","tokens":1366,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is straightforward, calculating the area of a circle using an approximate pi value. However, variable names like \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive, and the method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too generic. Using Math.PI would be better than hardcoding. It\u0027s easy to comprehend but readability could improve with better naming conventions.","tokens":1491,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and implements leap year check logic clearly with proper indentation. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is not descriptive, and parameter \u0027a\u0027 lacks meaning, making it harder to understand intent without context. The else clause is redundant; could return the condition directly for better conciseness.","tokens":1520,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a clear ternary operator to avoid division by zero, making the logic easy to follow. However, the method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca are nonsensical and unrelated to the operation, severely hindering comprehension and readability. As a Portuguese speaker, I recognize the words as vegetables/fruits, but they provide no context for the variables\u0027 purpose.","tokens":1488,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical, food-related names in Portuguese (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata) for methods and variables, making it extremely difficult to comprehend the intent or functionality. It manipulates presumed custom fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, but without meaningful identifiers, readability is severely compromised. The logic is simple, but obfuscated naming drops the score low.","tokens":1653,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor readability due to cryptic variable names like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, and lack of comments. The logic uses unnecessary String arrays and conversions, with confusing indexing (e.g., array size p.length()+1, loops from end). The digit summing for multiples of 2 is convoluted, making comprehension difficult without deep analysis.","tokens":1993,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
