{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method name calc is vague and does not indicate its purpose, such as calculating triangle area. Parameter names b and a, and variable r are not descriptive, reducing comprehension. The code is syntactically simple and short, but lacks comments or context, making it harder to understand intent without additional information.","tokens":1362,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which seem like herb names in Portuguese, providing no insight into the methods purpose. The logic involves a modulo and negation to return a Month, but its completely obfuscated, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":1398,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with proper indentation and implements a leap year check correctly. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear, and parameter \u0027a\u0027 lacks descriptiveness, reducing comprehension of intent. It could be simplified by directly returning the condition instead of using if-else.","tokens":1469,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical vegetable-themed variable names in Portuguese (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata), which severely obscures intent and makes comprehension difficult. It incorrectly treats DoubleSummaryStatistics as having direct fields like batata, which it doesnt. Structure is simple, but lack of meaningful names drops readability low.","tokens":1499,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a clear ternary operator for conditional division, avoiding division by zero. However, the method and invoked method names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca) are nonsensical and unrelated to any apparent purpose, severely hindering readability and comprehension. No comments or context provided, making it difficult to understand the intent without external knowledge.","tokens":1467,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code snippet suffers from extremely poor variable naming, using unrelated terms like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 that provide no insight into their purpose, making it very hard to comprehend. The logic is concise but obscured by this, requiring significant effort to decipher the month-adding functionality.","tokens":1481,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and calculates the area of a circle using a hardcoded pi value. It is easy to comprehend with straightforward logic and no complex structures. However, variable names like P and a could be more descriptive (e.g., PI and area), and using Math.PI would be better. Method name calc is vague; calculateArea would improve readability. Overall, highly readable for its brevity.","tokens":1483,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical Portuguese food-related names for variables and methods, severely hindering readability and comprehension. While the structure is a simple loop creating nodes with colors, the obfuscated naming makes it difficult to grasp the intent or logic without extensive effort.","tokens":1731,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is obscure and unrelated to its apparent purpose, possibly returning a quarter-start month. Variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is nonsensical and not descriptive. Logic with ordinal()/3*3 is somewhat decipherable but lacks context, comments, or clear intent, severely impacting readability and comprehension.","tokens":1548,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code has poor variable names like p, d, s, making intent unclear. Loops use confusing indices and unnecessary string parsing for simple digit operations. No comments, magic numbers, and convoluted structure reduce readability significantly.","tokens":2274,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
