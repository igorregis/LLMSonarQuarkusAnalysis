{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and short, but readability suffers from a vague method name \u0027calc\u0027 and non-descriptive parameters \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027. The variable \u0027r\u0027 lacks meaning, and there are no comments to explain the intent, likely calculating a triangle\u0027s area, reducing overall comprehension.","tokens":1313,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is non-descriptive and seems unrelated to its purpose, possibly a Portuguese word for thyme, which confuses intent. The array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) is also poorly named. The logic with ordinal() suggests quarter calculation for months, but obscure names severely hinder readability and comprehension.","tokens":1318,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and well-structured with proper indentation, making it readable. The logic is straightforward for a leap year check. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive, reducing ease of comprehension without context. It could be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression.","tokens":1372,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple, using a clear ternary operator to avoid division by zero. However, the method names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca) are nonsensical and unrelated to the operation, making it hard to understand the intent and purpose, which severely reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":1425,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and calculates the area of a circle using a hardcoded pi value. It is easy to comprehend with straightforward logic and minimal lines. However, variable names like P and a could be more descriptive (e.g., PI and area), and the method name calc is vague; calculateArea would be better. Using Math.PI would improve accuracy and readability.","tokens":1408,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027paprica\u0027 and parameter \u0027alecrim\u0027 are non-descriptive, using unrelated Portuguese spice words, which obscures intent. The logic involves a cryptic call to \u0027menta\u0027 with a negative modulo operation, lacking context or comments, making comprehension difficult despite simple syntax.","tokens":1386,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical vegetable-themed names in Portuguese (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata) that provide no insight into purpose or functionality, making it extremely hard to comprehend. Assumes undefined variables and accesses non-existent fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, further obscuring intent.","tokens":1591,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical Portuguese food-related variable names like abobora, inhame, and alcachofra, severely hindering readability and comprehension. Undefined elements such as aspargos, aipo, and MILHOS add confusion. Apparent errors, like feijaoVerde.nextFloat() on an int variable, suggest bugs. While the loop structure is discernible, overall ease of understanding is very low due to obfuscation.","tokens":1789,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code snippet has extremely poor readability due to nonsensical and unrelated variable names like menta, nozMoscada, oregano, and pimentaCaiena, which obscure the method\u0027s purpose. It seems to perform month arithmetic using modulo 12 and an array, but without meaningful identifiers, comprehension is severely hindered. The structure is simple, but naming choices make it nearly incomprehensible.","tokens":1521,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic variable names like p, s, d, making purpose unclear. Relies on strings for numeric operations, leading to unnecessary parsing and substring manipulations. Loops have confusing indices, off-by-one issues, and null checks, reducing readability. Requires significant effort to understand as a check digit calculator.","tokens":1909,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
