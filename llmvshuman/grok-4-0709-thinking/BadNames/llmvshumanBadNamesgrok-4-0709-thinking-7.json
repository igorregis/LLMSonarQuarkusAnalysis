{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable names like \u0027menta\u0027, \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, which appear to be Portuguese spice terms, making it extremely difficult to understand the intent. The logic seems to handle month arithmetic, possibly in a Month enum, but the obfuscated naming severely hampers readability and comprehension. The structure is simple, but that\u0027s overshadowed by poor naming conventions.","tokens":1468,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical, non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which appear to be Portuguese words for spices rather than meaningful identifiers. This severely hampers readability and comprehension, making it difficult to understand the methods purpose or logic without additional context. The syntax is basic but the obfuscated naming drops the score low.","tokens":1299,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and performs a basic calculation, likely triangle area, making it easy to follow mathematically. However, readability is hindered by generic method name \u0027calc\u0027 and vague parameter names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027, which lack descriptiveness. Variable \u0027r\u0027 is also non-explanatory. Better naming would improve comprehension without altering functionality.","tokens":1306,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is simple and correctly implements leap year logic, with proper indentation and structure. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is unclear and non-descriptive, and the parameter \u0027a\u0027 lacks meaning, reducing comprehension. It could be simplified by directly returning the condition instead of using if-else.","tokens":1401,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is non-descriptive and unrelated to its apparent purpose, possibly returning a quarter-starting month. The array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 has an obscure name, and the logic using ordinal() / 3 * 3 is cryptic without context, making the code extremely hard to read and comprehend.","tokens":1392,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple with a ternary operator to avoid division by zero, but the method names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca) are nonsensical and not descriptive, making it hard to understand the purpose and reducing overall readability.","tokens":1407,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is simple and calculates the circle area clearly. Variable names like P and a are somewhat vague; better to use PI and area for clarity. Hardcoding pi is acceptable but Math.PI is preferable for precision. No comments, but the logic is easy to follow overall.","tokens":1418,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical Portuguese food-related variable names like abobora, inhame, and alcachofra, which obscure the purpose and logic. Undefined variables such as aspargos, aipo, and MILHOS add confusion. There\u0027s a likely error with feijaoVerde.nextFloat() since feijaoVerde is an int. While the loop structure for creating tree nodes is basic, the obfuscation severely hampers readability and comprehension.","tokens":1808,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code employs nonsensical Portuguese vegetable names for variables and methods, severely hindering comprehension. It incorrectly accesses non-existent fields in DoubleSummaryStatistics, suggesting compilation issues. No comments or clear structure, making the purpose opaque and readability extremely poor.","tokens":1661,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor variable names like dv, p, s, d, obscuring purpose. Loops use confusing reverse indexing, unnecessary string-int conversions, and awkward array handling with null checks and unused index 0. Structure makes comprehension difficult without extensive analysis, though it seems to implement a check digit algorithm.","tokens":2023,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
