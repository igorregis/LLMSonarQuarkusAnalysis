{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is simple and concise, making it easy to follow the logic. However, the method name \u0027calc\u0027 is too vague, and parameters \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 along with variable \u0027r\u0027 lack descriptive names, reducing comprehension without context. No comments explain the purpose, likely triangle area calculation. Overall, readability is mediocre due to poor naming conventions.","tokens":1281,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is non-descriptive and seems unrelated to its purpose, possibly meaning \u0027thyme\u0027 in Portuguese, which confuses intent. \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is also obscure, likely \u0027cayenne pepper\u0027. The logic with ordinal() suggests quarter calculation for months, but cryptic names severely hinder readability and comprehension.","tokens":1337,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code snippet has poor readability due to meaningless variable names like menta, nozMoscada, oregano, and pimentaCaiena, which obscure the intent. It seems to add a modulo 12 value to a months ordinal and return from an array, but the spice-themed names make comprehension difficult despite the simple structure.","tokens":1438,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical, non-descriptive names like paprica, alecrim, and menta, which appear to be Portuguese words for spices rather than meaningful identifiers. This severely hampers readability and comprehension. The logic involves obscure operations like modulo and negation without context or comments. Assuming Month is java.time.Month, the snippet lacks clarity on what menta does, making it hard to understand intent or functionality.","tokens":1411,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is structurally simple, using a ternary operator for conditional division, which is concise. However, readability is severely hampered by nonsensical method names like getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca, which do not convey intent or meaning, making comprehension difficult without context. The final keyword on the method is unusual but not incorrect. Overall, poor naming choices lower the ease of understanding.","tokens":1387,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses nonsensical variable names like abobora, inhame, and alcachofra, which are Portuguese words for vegetables, making it extremely hard to understand intent. Undefined variables such as aspargos, aipo, and MILHOS add confusion. Logic is obscured, with potential errors like calling nextFloat on an int. No comments or structure aid comprehension.","tokens":1825,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and correctly implements leap year logic, with proper indentation and structure, making it easy to follow. However, the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 and parameter \u0027a\u0027 are not descriptive, hindering immediate comprehension of its purpose. It could be simplified by directly returning the boolean condition instead of using if-else.","tokens":1556,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is simple and clearly computes the area of a circle using pi * r^2. It\u0027s easy to comprehend due to its brevity and straightforward logic. However, readability is hindered by non-descriptive variable names like \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 (better as \u0027PI\u0027 and \u0027area\u0027), a vague method name \u0027calc\u0027, and a hardcoded pi value instead of using Math.PI for better maintainability.","tokens":1470,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code employs cryptic vegetable-themed names for variables and methods (e.g., gengibre, pimenta, batata), which obscure the intent and logic. It accesses non-standard fields on DoubleSummaryStatistics, likely causing compilation issues. While the structure is simple, the lack of meaningful identifiers severely hampers readability and comprehension.","tokens":1670,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code has poor variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027s\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, leading to confusion. Loops use awkward indexing (e.g., array from 1 to length, skipping 0), and excessive string parsing/conversions obscure the logic, which appears to implement the Luhn algorithm but is hard to follow without comments.","tokens":2092,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
