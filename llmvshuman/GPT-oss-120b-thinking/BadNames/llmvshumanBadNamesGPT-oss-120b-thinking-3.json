{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is short and clear, performing a basic area calculation. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Using a final constant for pi is good practice, though naming could be improved (PI, radius, area). Overall readability is high with minimal complexity.","tokens":410,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a single return statement. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":407,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses vague names (s, d, n) and a String array to hold numeric values, causing unnecessary conversions. Loop indices are confusing with off‑by‑one handling, and the logic for digit doubling and summing is spread across three loops without comments. Overall the code is hard to follow and could be simplified dramatically.","tokens":722,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are non‑descriptive, making the purpose unclear. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is terse and not commented, so readers must infer its intent. While the syntax is simple, the lack of meaningful identifiers and documentation reduces readability significantly.","tokens":527,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and does a single arithmetic operation which is easy to follow. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and the method name does not convey its purpose, and there are no comments. Overall readability is decent but could be improved.","tokens":514,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and parameter use unrelated Portuguese words that do not convey intent, and the called function menta is undefined in the snippet. The single line uses a negative modulo without explanation, making the purpose unclear. Lack of comments and vague naming reduces readability significantly.","tokens":590,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method performs a simple month offset calculation but uses unrelated Portuguese spice names for variables and the method, making the intent unclear. The logic itself is straightforward, but the naming hurts readability and comprehension.","tokens":628,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variable and method names are in Portuguese and do not convey their purpose, and the custom DoubleSummaryStatistics fields are unknown. The logic is simple arithmetic and min/max calls, but without context it is hard to understand. Readability is limited, so a score of 4.","tokens":791,"name":"Combine.java"}
