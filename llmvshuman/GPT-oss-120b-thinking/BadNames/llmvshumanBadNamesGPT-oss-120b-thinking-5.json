{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a single return statement. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":407,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are non‑descriptive, making intent unclear. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is cryptic without comments, and the code relies on external context (enum ordinal and array pimentaCaiena). While syntactically simple, overall readability is low.","tokens":527,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, performing a single arithmetic operation and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive, and there are no comments or JavaDoc, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":515,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names and three loops with confusing bounds. It relies heavily on String conversions and an unnecessary String array, making the logic hard to follow. No comments explain the purpose, and magic numbers appear. Although it implements a Luhn‑like checksum, the implementation is difficult to read and could be much clearer.","tokens":755,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and parameter names are obscure and in Portuguese, the purpose of the negative modulo calculation is unclear, and it calls an undefined method menta, making the intent hard to understand and overall readability low","tokens":624,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method performs a simple month offset calculation, but the variable and method names are unrelated to their purpose, making the intent hard to grasp. The use of ordinal() and array indexing is clear, yet the obscure naming reduces readability significantly.","tokens":687,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variables like batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim are not self-explanatory and the DoubleSummaryStatistics type is used with non-standard fields, making the intent unclear. The flow is simple but a reader must guess the purpose, reducing readability.","tokens":807,"name":"Combine.java"}
