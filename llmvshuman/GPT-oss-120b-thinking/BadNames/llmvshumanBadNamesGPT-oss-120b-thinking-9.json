{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and does one clear calculation. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, a for area). Using a final constant for pi is good practice, though naming it P instead of PI is less conventional. Overall the code is easy to read with minimal complexity.","tokens":419,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses vague names (s, d, n) and a String array to hold numeric values, causing unnecessary conversions. Loop indices are confusing with off‑by‑one handling, and the logic for digit doubling and summing is spread across three loops without comments. Overall the code is hard to follow and could be simplified dramatically.","tokens":722,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that give no clue about purpose. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is not self‑explanatory and lacks comments, making the intent hard to grasp. While the syntax is simple, the lack of meaningful identifiers and documentation reduces readability significantly.","tokens":529,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are obscure foreign words, providing no clue about purpose. The single return statement uses a negative modulo and calls an undefined method menta, making the intent hard to infer. Lack of comments further reduces readability.","tokens":616,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variables like batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim are not self-explanatory and the DoubleSummaryStatistics type is used with non-standard fields, making the intent unclear. The flow is simple but a reader must guess the purpose, reducing readability.","tokens":807,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses whimsical non English variable names and an unclear array pimentaCaiena, making the intent hard to grasp. The arithmetic with magic numbers 12 and ordinal() is not explained, so a reader must infer month rotation logic. Overall readability is low.","tokens":792,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
