{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure and unrelated variable names, making the intent hard to follow. Important identifiers like aipo, aspargos, MILHOS, and GRAO_DE_BICO are undefined in the snippet, adding confusion. The control flow is simple but the naming and missing context severely reduce readability and comprehension.","tokens":633,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are obscure, making intent unclear. The arithmetic index calculation is simple but without comments the purpose is hard to infer, reducing readability and comprehension.","tokens":508,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names and three loops with confusing bounds. It relies heavily on String conversions and an unnecessary String array, making the logic hard to follow. No comments explain the purpose, and magic numbers appear. Although it implements a Luhn‑like checksum, the implementation is difficult to read and could be much clearer.","tokens":755,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and parameter names are obscure foreign words that give no clue about their role. The return type Month suggests a date concept but the call to menta is undefined here. The single expression uses a negative modulo which is not self‑explanatory, making the code hard to read and understand.","tokens":645,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method is short but uses whimsical Portuguese identifiers that do not convey intent. It accesses fields of a custom DoubleSummaryStatistics class that are not standard, and calls an unknown method abobora. No comments or documentation are present, making the purpose unclear and readability low.","tokens":785,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses whimsical non English variable names and an unclear array pimentaCaiena, making the intent hard to grasp. The arithmetic with magic numbers 12 and ordinal() is not explained, so a reader must infer month rotation logic. Overall readability is low.","tokens":792,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
