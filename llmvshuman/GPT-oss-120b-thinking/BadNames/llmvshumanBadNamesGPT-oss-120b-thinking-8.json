{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a single return statement. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":407,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and does one clear calculation. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Using a final constant for pi is good practice, though naming it PI would be clearer. Overall the code is easy to read with minimal complexity.","tokens":419,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses obscure variable names unrelated to its purpose, making the intent hard to follow. It references undefined fields like aipo, aspargos, MILHOS and constants, adding confusion. The control flow is simple but the naming and missing context reduce readability significantly.","tokens":671,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, performing a single arithmetic operation. However variable names b and a are non‑descriptive, which slightly reduces clarity. Adding a comment or using meaningful names would improve readability, but overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":496,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that give no clue about purpose. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is not self‑explanatory and lacks comments, making the intent hard to grasp. While the syntax is simple, the naming and lack of documentation reduce readability significantly.","tokens":528,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names and three loops with confusing bounds. It relies heavily on String conversions and an unnecessary String array, making the logic hard to follow. No comments explain the purpose, and magic numbers appear. Although it implements a Luhn‑like checksum, the implementation is difficult to read and could be much clearer.","tokens":755,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses obscure Portuguese food related variable names that hide its purpose, making it hard to understand. Although the arithmetic is simple, the lack of comments and unclear naming reduce readability significantly.","tokens":571,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name paprica, variable alecrim and called function menta are obscure and give no clue about purpose. The single return line uses a negative modulo expression without explanation, making the intent hard to infer. Lack of comments or descriptive naming severely reduces readability and comprehension.","tokens":614,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variables like batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim are not self-explanatory and the DoubleSummaryStatistics type is used with non-standard fields, making the intent unclear. The flow is simple but a reader must guess the purpose, reducing readability.","tokens":807,"name":"Combine.java"}
