{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated Portuguese food names for variables, making intent unclear. It references undefined symbols (aipo, aspargos, MILHOS, DynamicTreeNode.GRAO_DE_BICO) so a reader cannot follow the flow. The loop logic and conditional assignments are confusing, and naming provides no semantic clues, resulting in very low readability.","tokens":703,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The snippet is very short but uses unrelated Portuguese spice names for variables and method, making the intent opaque. The arithmetic is simple, but without meaningful identifiers a reader must infer purpose, reducing readability and comprehension significantly.","tokens":543,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and parameter names are obscure and unrelated to the return type, there is no documentation, and the single expression uses a negative modulo which is not self‑explanatory, making the intent hard to grasp","tokens":584,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses non‑descriptive names, mixed loops, off‑by‑one indexing and repeated string‑to‑int conversions. The algorithm resembles Luhn but is implemented in a convoluted way without comments or clear structure, making it hard to follow and error‑prone, which lowers readability significantly.","tokens":752,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variable and method names are in Portuguese and do not convey their purpose, and the custom DoubleSummaryStatistics fields are unknown. The logic is simple arithmetic and min/max calls, but without context it is hard to understand. Readability is limited, so a score of 4.","tokens":791,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name tomilho and the variable pimentaCaiena give no clue about their purpose, making the intent obscure. The expression (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is a cryptic way to round down to a multiple of three and is not explained. While the code is short and syntactically correct, the lack of meaningful names and comments reduces readability significantly.","tokens":708,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
