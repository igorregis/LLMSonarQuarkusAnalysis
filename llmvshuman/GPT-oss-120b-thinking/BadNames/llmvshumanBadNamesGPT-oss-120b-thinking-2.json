{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single return statement with a ternary operator, which keeps the logic compact. However, the naming (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) is non‑standard and may confuse readers, and the ternary hides a simple conditional that could be clearer with an if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":469,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses obscure non English variable names and unclear intent, making it hard to understand its purpose. The arithmetic is simple but the naming and lack of comments reduce readability significantly.","tokens":597,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that give no clue about purpose. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is not self‑explanatory and lacks comments, making the intent hard to grasp. While the syntax is simple, the lack of meaningful identifiers reduces readability significantly.","tokens":527,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and parameter are obscure and unrelated to the return type, the single line uses a negative modulo without explanation, and the called function menta is undefined in this snippet, making the intent unclear and hard to follow","tokens":602,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names, mixed indexing, and unnecessary String conversions. Loops are hard to follow, with off by one indexing and magic numbers that obscure intent. No comments explain the algorithm. While it implements a Luhn like check digit, the code is difficult to read and maintain.","tokens":882,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Variables like batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim are not self-explanatory and the DoubleSummaryStatistics type is used with non-standard fields, making the intent unclear. The flow is simple but a reader must guess the purpose, reducing readability. Score 4","tokens":810,"name":"Combine.java"}
