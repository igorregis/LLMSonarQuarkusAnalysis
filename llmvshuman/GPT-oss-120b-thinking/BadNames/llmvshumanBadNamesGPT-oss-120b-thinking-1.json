{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is vague and does not convey its purpose, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a single return statement. These minor issues prevent a perfect score but overall readability remains good.","tokens":413,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and does a single clear calculation. Variable names are short but meaningful (r for radius, a for area). Using a final constant for pi is good practice, though naming it P instead of PI is less conventional. Overall the code is easy to read and understand, with no complex logic.","tokens":423,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses straightforward arithmetic, making it easy to follow. However the parameter names b and a are non‑descriptive, and there is no documentation, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved with meaningful names and comments.","tokens":506,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that give no clue about purpose. The calculation (ordinal() / 3) * 3 is not self‑explanatory and lacks comments, making the intent hard to grasp. While the syntax is simple, the lack of meaningful identifiers reduces readability significantly.","tokens":527,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names, mixed string and integer conversions, off‑by‑one indexing and three loops without comments, making the logic hard to follow. The intent (a mod‑10 check digit) is hidden behind unnecessary string handling, reducing clarity.","tokens":833,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and parameter names are non descriptive and unrelated to the logic, making the intent unclear. The single line uses a simple modulo and negation but without comments the purpose of calling menta is obscure. The short length helps a bit, but overall readability is low.","tokens":698,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is short and uses simple statements, but the variable and method names are in Portuguese and do not convey meaning to most readers. The custom DoubleSummaryStatistics type is unclear, and lack of comments makes intent ambiguous, reducing readability. Overall comprehension is moderate, hence a mid‑range score.","tokens":786,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses whimsical non English variable names and an unclear array pimentaCaiena, making the intent hard to grasp. The arithmetic with magic numbers 12 and ordinal() is not explained, so a reader must infer month rotation logic. Overall readability is low.","tokens":792,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
