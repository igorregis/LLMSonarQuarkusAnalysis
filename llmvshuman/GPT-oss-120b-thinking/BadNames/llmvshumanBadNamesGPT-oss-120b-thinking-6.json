{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is not descriptive, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Minor naming and style issues keep the readability from being perfect.","tokens":410,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses obscure variable names unrelated to its purpose, making the intent hard to follow. It references undefined symbols and relies on magic constants, which reduces clarity. The control flow is simple but the naming and lack of comments hinder readability, resulting in a low comprehension score.","tokens":671,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single ternary expression, which keeps it concise. However the variable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) are non‑standard and obscure the intent, and the ternary makes the logic slightly harder to read than an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":471,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and parameter use unrelated Portuguese words that do not convey intent, and the called function menta is undefined in the snippet. The single line uses a negative modulo without explanation, making the purpose unclear. Lack of comments and vague naming reduces readability significantly.","tokens":590,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that do not convey intent, there are no comments, and the arithmetic (ordinal()/3)*3 is not immediately clear, making the purpose hard to grasp despite the short length and standard syntax.","tokens":605,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses cryptic variable names, mixed indexing, and unnecessary String conversions which make the logic hard to follow. Loops are written backwards with off by one indices and the purpose of the array d is unclear. Lack of comments and poor naming reduce readability, giving a low score.","tokens":860,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses obscure Portuguese variable names that do not convey intent, making the purpose hard to infer. Although the logic is a simple modulo calculation on a month enum, the lack of comments and unconventional naming reduce readability significantly.","tokens":659,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The method is short but the naming is obscure. Portuguese variable names like batata, salsa, abobora hide intent and the custom DoubleSummaryStatistics class is not standard, making the fields unclear. The flow (additions, two calls to abobora, min/max updates) is simple, but overall comprehension suffers from vague names.","tokens":823,"name":"Combine.java"}
