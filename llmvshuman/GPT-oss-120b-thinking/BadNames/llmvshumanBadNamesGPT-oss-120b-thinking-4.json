{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear control flow, making it easy to follow. However the method name isAB is vague and does not convey its purpose, and the explicit if‑else returning true/false could be simplified to a single return statement. These minor issues prevent a perfect score but overall readability remains good.","tokens":413,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method uses obscure, unrelated variable names, many undefined identifiers and reuses a variable before initialization. The loop logic is hard to follow, with unclear purpose and inconsistent naming. Lack of comments and poor structure make comprehension difficult, resulting in a very low readability score.","tokens":662,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computes area using a clear formula. Variable names are short but understandable (r for radius, P for pi, a for area). Use of final for pi is good. Minor naming could be improved, but overall readability is high.","tokens":466,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses a single return statement with a ternary operator, which keeps the logic compact. However, the naming (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) is non‑standard and may confuse readers, and the ternary hides the conditional flow that could be clearer with an explicit if‑else. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":470,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and straightforward, computing (b*a)/2 and returning the result. However the parameter names b and a are not descriptive and there are no comments, which slightly reduces clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved.","tokens":517,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses non‑descriptive names, mixed loops with confusing bounds, repeated conversions between String and int, and an off‑by‑one array that makes the logic hard to follow. The intent (a Luhn‑like checksum) is not obvious without comments, reducing readability.","tokens":762,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method and parameter names are obscure and in Portuguese, the purpose of the negative modulo operation is not explained, and the called menta method is undefined, making the snippet hard to understand and low in readability","tokens":629,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method name and variable are obscure Portuguese words that do not convey intent, there are no comments, and the arithmetic (ordinal()/3)*3 is not immediately clear, making the purpose hard to grasp despite the short length and standard syntax.","tokens":605,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The method is short and uses simple arithmetic and standard Math calls, which makes the flow easy to follow. However the variable and method names are in Portuguese and refer to undefined fields of DoubleSummaryStatistics, so the purpose is unclear without additional context. Lack of comments reduces readability.","tokens":759,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method performs a month offset calculation but uses unrelated Portuguese spice names for variables and method, making the intent unclear. The logic itself is simple, but the naming hurts readability, leading to a low score.","tokens":689,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
