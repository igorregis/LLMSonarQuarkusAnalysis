{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑documented in Portuguese and uses clear variable names. The comment explains the leap‑year rule and the conditional logic is straightforward. Only minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly, but overall it is highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":491,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, self‑explanatory and uses clear Portuguese naming. Comments describe purpose, parameters and formula, aiding understanding. Variable names are meaningful and the logic follows a single straightforward calculation. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI, but overall readability is excellent.","tokens":468,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional that could be simplified, but overall it is easy to follow","tokens":804,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, written in Portuguese, and explains edge cases and the related getSoma method. Naming follows conventions, there is no complex logic, and the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":647,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the intent easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear variable names and simple arithmetic. Comments describe the combine operation and the compensation step. No complex control flow or nesting, making it easy to follow. The only minor issue is that comments are in Portuguese, which could hinder non‑Portuguese readers, but the code itself remains readable.","tokens":753,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose in clear Portuguese and the method name is self-descriptive. The one-line implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge, but overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":783,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-explanatory, with clear Portuguese documentation that describes the wrap-around behavior and immutability. The implementation delegates to soma with a negated modulo, which is concise but may require a quick glance to understand the sign handling. Overall easy to read.","tokens":833,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
