{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese Javadoc and inline comments, uses descriptive names, and follows a straightforward calculation. The constant PI is defined locally, which is easy to understand though using Math.PI would be more idiomatic. Overall the code is very readable and easy to follow.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑documented in Portuguese and uses clear variable names. The comment explains the leap‑year rule and the conditional logic is straightforward. Only minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly, but overall readability and comprehension are excellent.","tokens":488,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and related method. Naming follows conventions, no complex logic is present, and the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":645,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the logic easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose in clear Portuguese and the method name is self-descriptive. The one-line implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge, but overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":779,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and the comment explains its purpose clearly. The code consists of a single return statement that calls soma with a negative remainder, which is easy to follow. The only slight confusion is the indirect use of soma for subtraction, but overall readability is high.","tokens":785,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
