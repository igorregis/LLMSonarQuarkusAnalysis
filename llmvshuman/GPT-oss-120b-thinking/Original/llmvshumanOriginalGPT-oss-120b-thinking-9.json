{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese Javadoc and inline comments, uses descriptive names, and follows standard formatting. The logic is straightforward: define PI, compute area, return it. Only minor improvement could be using Math.PI, but overall readability is excellent.","tokens":475,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear JavaDoc, descriptive parameter name, simple conditional logic with a comment explaining the leap year rule, and no unnecessary code. The return could be simplified but readability is already excellent","tokens":542,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the logic easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and related method. Naming follows conventions, no complex logic is present, and the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":645,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is a single concise line that uses ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":686,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with English code, uses a String array with an extra slot and off-by-one loops, converts numbers to strings to split digits, and manually sums them. This makes the algorithm hard to follow despite comments; a simple int based implementation would be clearer.","tokens":1325,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-explanatory, with clear Portuguese documentation that describes the wrap-around behavior and immutability. The implementation delegates to soma with a negated modulo, which is concise but may require a quick glance to understand the sign handling. Overall easy to read.","tokens":833,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
