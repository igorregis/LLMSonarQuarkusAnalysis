{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑documented and uses clear Portuguese naming. The comment explains the leap‑year rule and the conditional logic is straightforward. The explicit true/false return could be simplified, but overall readability is high and the intent is immediately obvious.","tokens":479,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable: clear Portuguese comments explain purpose, parameters and return value. Method name and variable names are descriptive. The calculation is straightforward and uses a locally defined constant PI, which is easy to understand. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI, but overall comprehension is excellent.","tokens":472,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, written in Portuguese, and explains edge cases and API notes. Naming follows conventions (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). Minor formatting tweaks could improve readability but overall it is very clear.","tokens":655,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the logic easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is a single concise line that uses ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":686,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and its purpose is clear from the Portuguese comment. It returns a month by delegating to soma with a negated modulo, which handles wrap‑around correctly. The single line implementation is easy to follow once the modulo sign inversion is understood, making the code overall readable.","tokens":788,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
