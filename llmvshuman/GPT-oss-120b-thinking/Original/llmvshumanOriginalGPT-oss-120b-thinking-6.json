{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well‑documented with a clear Javadoc, uses descriptive names and simple logic. The condition for leap year is explicit and easy to follow. Minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly, but overall readability and comprehension are high.","tokens":478,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese documentation, descriptive name, and inline comments explaining each step. Variable names are meaningful and the calculation follows a straightforward formula. The only minor drawback is redefining PI instead of using Math.PI, but overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic to wrap months around the year. The modulo operation and array lookup are concise, and the Javadoc explains behavior and immutability. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but readability remains high.","tokens":668,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory; JavaDoc in Portuguese clearly describes behavior, edge case handling and related method. Uses ternary operator for brevity, relies on well‑named getters. No complex logic, making it easy to understand.","tokens":687,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":683,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-explanatory, with clear Portuguese documentation that describes the wrap-around behavior and immutability. The implementation delegates to soma with a negated modulo, which is concise but may require a quick glance to understand the sign handling. Overall easy to read.","tokens":833,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
