{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑documented in Portuguese and uses clear variable names. The comment explains the leap‑year rule and the conditional logic is straightforward. Only minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly, but overall it is highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":491,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese documentation, descriptive name, and inline comments explaining each step. Variable names are meaningful and the calculation follows a straightforward formula. The only minor drawback is redefining PI instead of using Math.PI, but overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and conditionals, and comments explain its purpose. Variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, but the mix of language and the font selection logic add slight complexity. Overall it is easy to follow for a Java developer","tokens":787,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with English code, uses a String array with an extra slot and off‑by‑one loops, and converts numbers to strings to split digits. This makes the flow hard to follow. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation could be clearer with integer arithmetic and better variable names.","tokens":1192,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and API notes. Naming follows Java conventions (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). Minor formatting tweaks could improve readability, but overall it is very clear.","tokens":655,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the logic easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":683,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and its purpose is clear from the Javadoc. It uses a simple modulo operation and delegates to soma, making the logic easy to follow. Variable names are meaningful and the code follows standard Java conventions, resulting in good readability.","tokens":680,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
