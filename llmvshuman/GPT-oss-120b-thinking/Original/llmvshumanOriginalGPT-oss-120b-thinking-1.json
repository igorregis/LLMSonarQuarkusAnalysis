{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable: clear Portuguese comments explain purpose, parameters and return value. Method name and variable names are descriptive. The constant PI is defined locally with a comment, and the formula is straightforward. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI, but overall comprehension is excellent.","tokens":470,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The method is concise, includes clear JavaDoc, uses a descriptive parameter name, and implements the leap year rule with a straightforward conditional. No extraneous logic or complex constructs are present, making it highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":531,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, the Javadoc explains behavior clearly and the code is concise. It uses simple arithmetic with modulo and array indexing, making the logic easy to follow. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but overall readability is high.","tokens":654,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a ternary operator to return the average or zero. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and related method. Naming follows conventions, no complex logic is present, and the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":645,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well commented in Portuguese and uses descriptive variable names, making the intent clear. The loop logic is straightforward, but the conditional font selection and alternating color add slight complexity. Magic constants and array checks are understandable but could be abstracted. Overall readability is good but not exceptional.","tokens":829,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":683,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise, uses clear variable names and standard Java APIs. Portuguese comments explain its purpose and null safety. The operations (adding counts, sums, compensation and updating min/max) are straightforward for anyone familiar with DoubleSummaryStatistics. Only the compensation logic may need a moment of thought, but overall readability is high.","tokens":621,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-explanatory, with clear Portuguese documentation that describes the wrap-around behavior and immutability. The implementation delegates to soma with a negated modulo, which is concise but may require a quick glance to understand the sign handling. Overall easy to read.","tokens":833,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
