{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese documentation, descriptive name, and inline comments explaining each step. Variable names are meaningful and the calculation follows a straightforward formula. The only minor drawback is redefining PI instead of using Math.PI, but overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":479,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The method is concise, includes clear JavaDoc, uses a descriptive parameter name, and implements the leap year rule with a straightforward conditional. No extraneous logic or complex constructs are present, making it highly readable and easy to comprehend.","tokens":531,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and simple arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation step. The flow is linear and easy to follow. No complex logic or hidden side effects, making it highly readable.","tokens":609,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. The modulo operation handles negative values correctly and the array lookup is simple. Minor concern is the cast from long to int, but it does not affect readability. Overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":641,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with unclear variable names and uses a String array with an extra slot, causing off‑by‑one loops. Converting digits to strings, splitting them, and recombining adds unnecessary complexity. While the algorithm is documented, the implementation is hard to follow, reducing readability.","tokens":1191,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory, using a clear ternary expression. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and API notes, which aids understanding. Naming follows conventions (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). Minor formatting tweaks could improve readability, but overall it is very clear.","tokens":646,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only minor drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to understand fully.","tokens":683,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and its purpose is clear from the Portuguese comment. It returns a month by delegating to soma with a negated modulo, which handles wrap‑around correctly. The single line implementation is easy to follow once the modulo sign inversion is understood, making the code overall readable.","tokens":788,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
