{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑documented in Portuguese and uses clear variable names. The comment explains the leap‑year rule and the conditional logic is straightforward. Only minor improvement could be returning the boolean expression directly, but overall it is highly readable and easy to understand.","tokens":491,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is short, has clear Portuguese Javadoc and inline comments, uses descriptive names, and follows a straightforward calculation. The constant PI is defined locally, which is simple but could use Math.PI. Overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":472,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method has a clear Javadoc comment, descriptive parameter names and a simple one-line calculation. Variable naming is self-explanatory and the code follows standard formatting, making it easy to read and understand. No complex logic is present.","tokens":555,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The JavaDoc explains the purpose clearly in Portuguese and the method name is self‑descriptive. The one‑line implementation is concise, using ordinal arithmetic to map any month to the first month of its quarter. The only drawback is the hidden ENUMS array, which requires external knowledge to fully understand.","tokens":634,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The method mixes Portuguese comments with English code, uses a String array sized num.length()+1 causing off‑by‑one indexing, and repeatedly converts numbers to strings to split digits. Loops are confusing (i\u003e0, i--) and manual digit handling obscures the Mod10 logic. While comments explain the algorithm, the implementation is unnecessarily complex, reducing readability.","tokens":1204,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is well structured with clear loops and comments, variable names are descriptive and the logic is straightforward. Minor issues are the use of magic constants, mixed language comments and a nested conditional for font selection that adds slight complexity, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":811,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self explanatory, using a clear ternary expression. The JavaDoc is thorough, describing behavior, edge cases and API notes, which aids understanding. Naming follows conventions (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). Minor formatting tweaks could improve readability, but overall it is very clear.","tokens":637,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is well documented in Portuguese, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic to wrap months around the year. The modulo operation and array lookup are concise, and the Javadoc explains immutability and negative values. Minor concern is casting long to int without range check, but readability remains high.","tokens":670,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short, uses clear variable names and straightforward arithmetic. Comments explain the purpose and the compensation subtraction. No complex logic or nested structures, making it easy to follow. Minor drawback is Portuguese comments which may limit non Portuguese readers.","tokens":696,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-explanatory, with clear Portuguese documentation that describes the wrap-around behavior and immutability. The implementation delegates to soma with a negated modulo, which is concise but may require a quick glance to understand the sign handling. Overall easy to read.","tokens":833,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
