{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Adding a comment or using a helper method would improve clarity, yet the code is short and functional, making it reasonably readable.","tokens":390,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory, using clear naming for count and sum. The ternary operator makes the logic compact, though a regular if‑else could be slightly more readable for beginners. No complex constructs, but the Portuguese method names may require context. Overall readability is high.","tokens":449,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, the constant PI is declared as final, the calculation is straightforward and formatted cleanly, making the code easy to read and understand. No complex logic or hidden side effects.","tokens":442,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are in Portuguese but clearly describe the purpose. Variable names are descriptive and the calculation is straightforward. The code is short, well‑structured and easy to understand. Minor improvement could be returning the expression directly, but readability is already high.","tokens":460,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and the intent is clear: it subtracts months by calling soma with a negative modulo value. However it contains a syntax error (missing semicolon after the return statement) and lacks context such as the definition of soma or the Month class. The mix of Portuguese identifiers may be fine for native speakers but reduces readability for others. These issues lower the overall comprehension score.","tokens":472,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear variable names, but the arithmetic with magic numbers and the ENUMS lookup is not explained, making the intent less obvious for readers unfamiliar with the enum implementation.","tokens":504,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name and variable are clear, the leap-year logic is expressed directly and easy to follow. The if-else returning true/false is redundant and could be replaced by a single return of the boolean expression, and lack of comments slightly reduces clarity, but overall readability is high.","tokens":547,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear variable names; it adds counts and sums, applies compensation, and updates min and max. The logic follows the expected combine operation for statistics. Lack of comments and the hidden sumWithCompensation method reduce clarity slightly, but overall it is easy to follow.","tokens":582,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and follows a clear linear flow. Variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, the loop logic and alternating colors are easy to follow. Minor issues are the mixed language of identifiers and the conditional font selection which could be clearer, but overall the code is readable.","tokens":768,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses many string conversions and confusing index calculations Variable names are short and do not explain purpose Loops have non intuitive limits and the array is sized one element larger than needed The algorithm is hard to follow and could be written more clearly","tokens":913,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
