{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is clear and follows standard leap‑year logic, using straightforward conditionals and proper naming. However, the explicit if‑else returning true/false is redundant; returning the boolean expression directly would be more concise. Overall readability is good but could be slightly improved.","tokens":414,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are descriptive in Portuguese, making its purpose clear. The calculation is straightforward and uses a well‑named local variable. The code is concise, follows standard formatting, and is easy to understand. Minor improvement could be input validation, but overall readability is high.","tokens":408,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory, using clear Portuguese naming for average, count and sum. The ternary operator cleanly handles division by zero. Readability is high despite the compact syntax, and no complex logic is present, making it easy to understand.","tokens":406,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Adding a comment or using a helper method would improve clarity, yet the code is short and functional, making it reasonably readable.","tokens":390,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are clear and self‑explanatory. The calculation follows a straightforward formula and uses a locally defined constant for PI, making the logic easy to follow. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI or a class‑level constant, but overall readability is high.","tokens":433,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear names like plus and months, making the intent obvious. However the magic number 12 appears twice, the cast from long to int is implicit, and the expression (ordinal() + (amount + 12)) % 12 is dense, which can hinder quick understanding for readers unfamiliar with the enum indexing trick.","tokens":533,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and uses clear Portuguese identifiers, but it contains syntax errors such as a missing semicolon after the return statement. It also lacks context for the soma method and the Month type, so the intent of subtracting months is not fully clear despite the simple modulo operation.","tokens":581,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear names like combine, count, simpleSum, min and max. It adds counts and sums, adjusts compensation, and updates min/max in a logical order that matches the intent of merging statistics. The only hidden detail is the sumWithCompensation method, but overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":631,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and follows a clear linear flow. Variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, the loop logic and alternating colors are easy to follow. Minor issues are the mixed language of identifiers and the conditional font selection which could be clearer, but overall the code is readable.","tokens":768,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses unclear variable names, a string array with extra slot, off by one indexing and several loops that obscure the algorithm. Magic numbers and no comments make the intent hard to see. Integer arithmetic would be clearer. Overall readability is low.","tokens":890,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
