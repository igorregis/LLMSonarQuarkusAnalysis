{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Using a more expressive approach or comments would improve readability, yet the logic is concise and functional.","tokens":384,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory, using clear Portuguese names for count, sum and average. The ternary operator cleanly handles division‑by‑zero, and the return type is explicit. Minor readability loss could come from the compact ternary, but overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":416,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are clear and self‑explanatory, the calculation follows a straightforward formula, and the constant PI is defined locally for readability. The code is short, well‑indented and easy to understand. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI or a class‑level constant, but overall readability is high.","tokens":442,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and the intent is clear: subtract months by adding a negative modulo value. However it contains a syntax error (missing semicolon) and lacks context such as the definition of soma or the Month class. Variable and method names are in Portuguese which may hinder non‑Portuguese readers. Overall readability is moderate but the errors lower its score.","tokens":458,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are descriptive in Portuguese, the calculation is a single clear expression, and the return is straightforward. The code follows standard formatting and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. Minor improvement could be input validation.","tokens":493,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses descriptive Portuguese names, making the purpose clear. The loop and alternating color logic are straightforward. However it depends on external fields (geradorNomes, contagemNomes, fontes, NOMES) not shown, and the font selection condition is slightly dense, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":709,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear names like plus and months, making the intent obvious. However the magic number 12 appears twice, the cast from long to int is implicit, and the expression (ordinal() + (amount + 12)) % 12 is dense, which can hinder quick understanding for readers unfamiliar with the enum indexing trick.","tokens":533,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear variable names, making the intent of merging statistics obvious. The two calls to sumWithCompensation handle compensated summation, which may be unfamiliar but the pattern is consistent. Lack of comments and reliance on an external method reduce clarity slightly, but overall readability is high.","tokens":594,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name and parameter are clear, the leap-year logic is correct and easy to follow. The if-else simply returns a boolean that could be returned directly, so there is a minor redundancy. Overall the code is readable and self-explanatory, earning a solid 8.","tokens":613,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses many string conversions and confusing index calculations Variable names are short and do not explain purpose Loops have non intuitive limits and the array is sized one element larger than needed The algorithm is hard to follow and could be written more clearly","tokens":913,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
