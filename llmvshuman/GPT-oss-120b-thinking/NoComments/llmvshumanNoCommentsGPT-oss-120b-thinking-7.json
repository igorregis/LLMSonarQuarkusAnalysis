{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Using a more expressive approach or comments would improve readability, yet the code is concise and functional.","tokens":384,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are clear and self‑explanatory, the calculation follows a straightforward formula, and the constant PI is defined locally for readability. The code is short, well‑structured and easy to understand. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI or a class‑level constant, but overall readability is high.","tokens":441,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name and parameter are clear, and the leap year logic is correctly expressed. The if‑else returning true/false is verbose; it could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Overall the code is easy to read, but minor redundancy prevents a perfect score.","tokens":497,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are descriptive in Portuguese, the calculation is a single clear expression, and the return is straightforward. The code is well formatted and easy to understand, though adding input validation could improve robustness.","tokens":474,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses descriptive Portuguese names, making the purpose clear. The loop and alternating color logic are straightforward. However it depends on external fields (geradorNomes, contagemNomes, fontes, NOMES) not shown, and the font selection condition is slightly dense, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":709,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and uses clear Portuguese names, but it contains syntax errors (missing semicolon) and lacks context for the soma method and Month type, making it hard to understand its intent. The modulo operation is simple, yet overall comprehension is limited.","tokens":542,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses clear names like combine, count, simpleSum, min and max. It adds counts and sums, adjusts compensation, and updates min/max in a logical order that matches the intent of merging statistics. The only hidden detail is the sumWithCompensation method, but overall the code is easy to read and understand.","tokens":631,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses many string conversions and confusing index calculations Variable names are short and do not explain purpose Loops have non intuitive limits and the array is sized one element larger than needed The algorithm is hard to follow and could be written more clearly","tokens":913,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear naming for the parameter and temporary variable. The arithmetic is compact but the magic constants 12 and the double modulo expression require a moment to understand the wrap around logic. Overall it is fairly easy to follow for someone familiar with enums.","tokens":655,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is concise and self-contained, using a ternary expression to prevent division by zero. Method names are descriptive, though they are in Portuguese which may require translation for non-speakers. No complex logic is present, making the code easy to understand.","tokens":764,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
