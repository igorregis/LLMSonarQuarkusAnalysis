{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Adding a comment or using a helper method would improve clarity, yet the code is short and functional, making it reasonably readable.","tokens":390,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, the constant PI is declared as final, the calculation is straightforward and formatted cleanly, making the code easy to read and understand. No complex logic or hidden side effects.","tokens":442,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name and variable are clear, the leap‑year logic is expressed directly and easy to follow. The if‑else returning true/false is redundant and could be replaced by a single return of the boolean expression, and lack of comments slightly reduces clarity, but overall readability is high.","tokens":533,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are descriptive in Portuguese, the calculation is a single clear expression, and the return is straightforward. The code follows standard formatting and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. Minor improvement could be input validation.","tokens":493,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses descriptive Portuguese names, making the purpose clear. The loop and alternating color logic are straightforward. However it depends on external fields (geradorNomes, contagemNomes, fontes, NOMES) not shown, and the font selection condition is slightly dense, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":709,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and uses clear Portuguese names, but it contains syntax errors (missing semicolon) and lacks context for the soma method and Month type, making it hard to understand its intent. The modulo operation is simple, yet overall comprehension is limited.","tokens":545,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear naming for the parameter and local variable. The arithmetic is compact but the magic constants (12) and the double modulo expression may require a moment to understand the wrap-around logic. Overall it is fairly readable for experienced Java developers.","tokens":589,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear variable names, making the intent of merging statistics obvious. The two calls to sumWithCompensation handle compensated summation, which may be unfamiliar but the pattern is consistent. Lack of comments and reliance on an external method reduce clarity slightly, but overall readability is high.","tokens":594,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method is short and self-contained, using a clear ternary expression to return the average or zero. Method names are descriptive, though they are in Portuguese which may require context. No complex logic or nesting, making it easy to understand.","tokens":628,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses many string conversions and confusing index calculations Variable names are short and do not explain purpose Loops have non intuitive limits and the array is sized one element larger than needed The algorithm is hard to follow and could be written more clearly","tokens":914,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
