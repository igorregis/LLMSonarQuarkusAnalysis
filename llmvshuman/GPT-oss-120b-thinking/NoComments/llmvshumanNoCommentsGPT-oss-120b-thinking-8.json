{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method name and purpose are clear in Portuguese, but the implementation uses a raw array lookup with arithmetic that may not be immediately obvious to all readers. Adding a comment or using a helper method would improve clarity, yet the code is short and functional, making it reasonably readable.","tokens":390,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and variable names are clear and self‑explanatory, the calculation follows a straightforward formula, and the constant PI is defined locally for readability. The code is short, well‑structured and easy to understand. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI or a class‑level constant, but overall readability is high.","tokens":441,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method is concise and self‑explanatory, using clear Portuguese names for count, sum and average. The ternary operator cleanly handles division‑by‑zero, and the return type is explicit. Minor readability loss could come from the compact ternary, but overall the code is easy to understand.","tokens":416,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name and parameter are clear, and the leap year logic is correctly expressed. The if‑else returning true/false is verbose; it could be simplified to a direct return of the boolean expression. Overall the code is easy to read, but minor redundancy prevents a perfect score.","tokens":497,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The method name and parameters are descriptive in Portuguese, the calculation is a single clear expression, and the return is straightforward. The code follows standard formatting and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. Minor improvement could be input validation.","tokens":493,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear variable names like count, simpleSum, min and max which makes the intent easy to follow. The call to sumWithCompensation twice, especially with a negative compensation, is a bit subtle and could use a comment, but overall the flow is straightforward.","tokens":567,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and the intent is clear: it subtracts months by calling soma with a negative modulo value. However it contains a syntax error (missing semicolon after the return statement) and lacks context such as the definition of soma or the Month class. The mix of Portuguese identifiers may be fine for native speakers but reduces readability for others. These issues lower the overall comprehension score.","tokens":472,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is concise and uses descriptive Portuguese names, making the purpose clear. The loop and alternating color logic are straightforward. However it depends on external fields (geradorNomes, contagemNomes, fontes, NOMES) not shown, and the font selection condition is slightly dense, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":709,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The method is short and uses clear naming for the parameter and temporary variable. The arithmetic is compact but the magic constants (12) and the double modulo expression require a moment to understand the wrap‑around logic. Overall it is fairly easy to follow for someone familiar with enums.","tokens":585,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The method uses many string conversions and confusing index calculations Variable names are short and do not explain purpose Loops have non intuitive limits and the array is sized one element larger than needed The algorithm is hard to follow and could be written more clearly with arithmetic operations Overall readability is poor","tokens":941,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
