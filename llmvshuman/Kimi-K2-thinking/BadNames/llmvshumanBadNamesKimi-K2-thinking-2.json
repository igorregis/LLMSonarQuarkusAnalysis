{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name isAB and parameter a are non-descriptive. The if-else block is redundant since the condition already returns boolean. Could be simplified to a single return statement. Poor naming makes it hard to understand the purpose (leap year check) without analyzing the logic.","tokens":1203,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to nonsensical Portuguese food names for variables/methods that completely obscure intent. Misleading parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics with non-existent fields. Unclear variable scope (instance vs local). No documentation. Logic is cryptic and maintenance would be nearly impossible.","tokens":1570,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena are cryptic and unrelated to functionality. The integer arithmetic is not self documenting. No comments explain intent. Readers cannot understand this returns first month of quarter without deep analysis. Names are misleading and maintainability is very poor despite concise logic.","tokens":1732,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor naming with unrelated food terms makes purpose incomprehensible. Magic number 12 lacks context. Method intent unclear without extensive analysis. Assumes external array exists. Zero comments. Only redeeming quality is brevity.","tokens":1792,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Metodo calc e parametro r sao genericos. Constante P e variavel a nao sao autoexplicativas. Usa numero magico 3.14159 em vez de Math.PI. Logica simples mas requer analise para entender que calcula area de circulo. Nomes ruins dificultam manutencao. Formato correto mas legibilidade comprometida.","tokens":1838,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor naming method paprica parameter alecrim and callee menta are meaningless. Negating modulo result is cryptic without context. Violates Java naming conventions and makes purpose completely opaque. Only positive is brevity.","tokens":1924,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name calc is too generic. Parameters b and a and variable r lack descriptive names making purpose unclear. The calculation is simple but requires inference to understand it calculates triangle area. No documentation. Could be improved with meaningful names like calculateTriangleArea(base, height) and direct return.","tokens":1936,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to completely meaningless Portuguese food names for variables and method. Contains critical compilation errors: primitive int feijaoVerde used as object with method call, plus undeclared variables (aspargos, MILHOS, aipo). Logic is convoluted with unclear null checks and array indexing. Code duplication in DadosAmostra instantiation. Method name coxa is non-descriptive. Overall structure is obfuscated and non-functional.","tokens":2231,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method names are cryptic and meaningless (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) making intent unclear. Ternary operator is concise but combined with poor naming hinders comprehension. Logic is simple division with zero guard but lacks semantic context. Positive aspects are brevity and correct syntax. Overall poor readability due to naming choices.","tokens":2146,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Nomes nao descritivos (dv, p, s, d). Indexacao confusa baseada em 1. Conversoes desnecessarias String e Integer. Logica ofuscada em 3 lacos. Ausencia de comentarios. Estrutura complexa e verbosa para soma de digitos. Dificil compreensao e manutencao.","tokens":5535,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
