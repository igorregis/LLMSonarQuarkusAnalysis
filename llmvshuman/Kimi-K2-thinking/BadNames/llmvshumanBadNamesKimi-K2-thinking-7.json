{"score":"1","reasoning":"Method and variables use unrelated Portuguese food names making comprehension impossible. Parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics lacks custom fields like batata/salsa so code wont compile. No documentation unclear side effects on instance fields. Operations mix addition method calls and min/max without clear intent. Completely unreadable without extensive context.","tokens":1347,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method and variables use unrelated Portuguese spice names making purpose unclear. Complex expression with magic numbers lacks comments. Assumes enum context and external array. The +12 modulo trick for negative handling is obscure. Overall very hard to comprehend without domain knowledge.","tokens":1294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Meaningless food-based names make code incomprehensible. Ternary structure is acceptable but naming is critical failure. Zero-division check is good. Cannot understand purpose without context.","tokens":1376,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Method and parameter names are completely non-descriptive and appear random. The logic is cryptic without context. Violates fundamental clean code principles, making it impossible to understand purpose without deep investigation. Extremely poor readability.","tokens":1372,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name calc and variables b a r are non-descriptive violating Java naming conventions. Simple arithmetic is clear but purpose is ambiguous without context. Lacks documentation. While code is concise poor naming significantly reduces readability.","tokens":1534,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability. Cryptic variable names (dv, p, s, d, d1, d2), unnecessary String/Integer conversions, confusing reverse loops with offset indices, magic numbers without context, and no comments. The Luhn algorithm is obfuscated by overly complex logic, making it very hard to understand, maintain, and debug. Significantly violates clean code principles.","tokens":1805,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Meaningless Portuguese food names for variables and method. feijaoVerde declared as int but used as object. Undefined variables aspargos MILHOS aipo aboboraMaca. Confusing logic with redundant if blocks. No comments. Critical compilation errors. Extremely poor readability and comprehension.","tokens":2026,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Generic method name calc and unclear variables P and a reduce readability. Should use Math.PI not hardcoded 3.14159. Parameter r is acceptable. No documentation. Simple logic but poor naming hurts maintainability.","tokens":1814,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name isAB and parameter a are non-descriptive making purpose unclear. Redundant if-else since condition already returns boolean. Logic is correct but poor naming and unnecessary code severely harm readability. Should directly return the boolean expression with meaningful names like isLeapYear and year.","tokens":1960,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena are meaningless. The arithmetic expression using ordinal is cryptic and requires analysis to understand it returns the first month of the quarter. No comments explain the intent. While concise and correct, the code is very difficult to comprehend without significant effort.","tokens":2585,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
