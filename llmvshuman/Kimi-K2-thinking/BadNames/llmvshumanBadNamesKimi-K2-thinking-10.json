{"score":"4","reasoning":"Method name isAB and parameter a are non-descriptive making intent unclear. The if-else block is redundant since the condition already evaluates to boolean. Could be simplified to direct return. Logic is standard but implementation is verbose and poorly named.","tokens":1429,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"Generic method name calc and unclear variables r P a reduce readability. Magic number 3.14159 should be Math.PI. Despite poor naming the short length makes it decipherable. Calculates circle area but requires mental effort. Descriptive names would make intention obvious.","tokens":1448,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method names paprica menta and parameter alecrim are cryptic and non-descriptive. Purpose is unclear without context. Negation and modulo lack explanation. While syntactically correct the naming severely hinders readability making comprehension extremely difficult.","tokens":1456,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Extremely poor readability due to meaningless Portuguese food names for variables that dont convey purpose. Contains compilation errors like using nextFloat on an int. Uses undefined variables with nonsense names. Magic numbers and constants with nonsensical names. Redundant if else logic. Mixing languages makes it worse. Virtually impossible to understand intent.","tokens":1895,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Naming uses unrelated Portuguese food terms (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) making intent completely opaque. Simple month offset logic is unnecessarily obscured. Public method with cryptic names violates basic readability principles. No comments or documentation.","tokens":1770,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena are meaningless Portuguese words unrelated to functionality. The integer arithmetic logic is cryptic without comments. While concise, the code requires significant effort to understand it returns the first month of the current quarter. Terrible naming makes maintenance difficult.","tokens":1974,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Codigo com nomenclatura completamente inadequada usando nomes de comida em portugues que nao refletem funcionalidade. Parametro pimenta do tipo DoubleSummaryStatistics e usado para acessar campos inexistentes (batata salsa tomate pepino alecrim berinjela). Metodo gengibre e chamadas abobora nao tem significado claro. Falta documentacao e contexto. Operacoes sao incompreensiveis. Nomes enganosos violam principios basicos de legibilidade.","tokens":2811,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Meaningless names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) obscure intent completely. Logic is simple and safe (guarded division) but forces code investigation. Single-line ternary is compact but less readable. Positives: final keyword, explicit 0.0d, zero-division protection. Poor naming makes comprehension very difficult.","tokens":2762,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Baixissima legibilidade. Nomes cripticos (dv,p,s,d,d1,d2). Logica confusa: loops invertidos, conversao String/Integer desnecessaria, array String inves de int, soma de digitos obscura. Requer grande esforco para entender calculo de digito verificador. Sem comentarios.","tokens":3799,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Generic method name and non-descriptive parameters (b, a). Variable r is ambiguous. Logic is simple but lacks semantic clarity. No documentation makes purpose unclear. Meaningful names and comments would greatly improve readability.","tokens":3757,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
