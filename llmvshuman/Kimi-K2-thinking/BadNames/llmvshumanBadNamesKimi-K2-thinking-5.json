{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method name isAB and parameter a are non-descriptive. Redundant if-else when condition directly returns boolean. Correct leap year logic but poor naming forces developers to analyze implementation to understand purpose. Could be simplified to return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);","tokens":1332,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses completely meaningless Portuguese food names for variables and methods that do not reflect their purpose. The parameter type DoubleSummaryStatistics is a standard Java class but the code accesses non-existent fields on it, suggesting either a custom class with a confusing name or broken code. Lack of context comments and clear intent makes it extremely difficult to understand. The naming convention actively hinders comprehension.","tokens":1590,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"Variable names are meaningless food items in Portuguese making code incomprehensible. Compilation error: int feijaoVerde has no nextFloat() method. Undefined variables aspargos MILHOS aipo. Poor logic with magic constant GRAO_DE_BICO and redundant conditional. No clarity on method purpose. Extremely low readability.","tokens":1822,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Extremely poor naming: paprica, alecrim and menta are non-English, meaningless terms. Negating modulo result is unclear logic. Dependency on unknown menta method makes purpose impossible to grasp. Only positive is brevity.","tokens":1655,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Extremely poor naming dv p s d d1 d2 makes comprehension nearly impossible. Unnecessary String array and Integer conversions add complexity. No comments explain the Luhn algorithm implementation. Off-by-one handling is confusing and error-prone. Logic is convoluted and requires significant effort to understand. Maintenance would be very difficult.","tokens":1965,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Method name tomilho and variable pimentaCaiena are meaningless Portuguese food terms unrelated to returning first month of quarter. The integer arithmetic (ordinal/3)*3 is cryptic and requires mental calculation. No comments explain intent. Violates clean code principles severely hindering readability despite concise implementation.","tokens":1774,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Portuguese spice names obscure intent. Complex arithmetic with magic number 12 lacks clarity. No comments. Logic appears to offset months using enum ordinal but requires reverse engineering. Redundant plus 12 before modulo indicates confusion. Violates basic naming conventions making comprehension extremely difficult.","tokens":2114,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Method and variable names are nondescriptive and unrelated to the operation (calculating a ratio). The ternary operator is concise but combined with poor naming makes intent unclear. No comments explain the purpose. While syntactically correct, the semantic opacity forces developers to guess the business logic, severely hindering maintainability.","tokens":2181,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"Metodo com nome generico \u0027calc\u0027 e parametros \u0027b\u0027 e \u0027a\u0027 sem significado claro. Variavel \u0027r\u0027 tambem nao descritiva. A logica (b*a)/2 e simples mas sem contexto fica ambigua. Falta documentacao. Nomes ruins dificultam manutencao e compreensao do proposito.","tokens":2463,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"Generic method name calc and poor variable names P and a hinder clarity. Uses magic number 3.14159 instead of Math.PI. Unnecessary intermediate variable. Lacks documentation. Simple structure but naming violates best practices requiring extra effort to understand intent.","tokens":2673,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
