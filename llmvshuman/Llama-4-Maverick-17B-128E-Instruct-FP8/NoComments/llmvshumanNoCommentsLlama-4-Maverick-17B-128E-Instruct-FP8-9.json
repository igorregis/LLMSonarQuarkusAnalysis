{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, clear and follows good Java naming conventions. The variable and method names are descriptive, making it easy to understand the code\u0027s purpose. The formula is correctly implemented.","tokens":245,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It correctly calculates the area of a circle. However, it uses a hardcoded value for PI instead of using Math.PI, which is more accurate and conventional in Java.","tokens":256,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is readable and follows standard Java naming conventions. The logic for determining a leap year is correctly implemented. However, the if-else statement is unnecessary as the condition can be directly returned, simplifying the code further.","tokens":275,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally readable, with clear variable names and a simple loop structure. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the method does multiple unrelated tasks. The use of magic numbers and lack of comments also detract from readability.","tokens":447,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is somewhat readable, but it lacks clear variable names and comments. The logic is complex and could be simplified. The use of a String array to store intermediate results is not ideal. The method does a specific calculation, but its purpose is not immediately clear without understanding the context.","tokens":498,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It assumes ENUMS is an array of Month enums and ordinal() returns the ordinal of the current enum. The logic is clear, calculating the first month of the quarter. However, ENUMS and the enum type are not defined in this snippet, which could cause some confusion.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It correctly uses the modulus operator to handle the subtraction of months. However, it assumes the existence of a \u0027soma\u0027 method and a \u0027Month\u0027 type, which are not shown in this snippet. The logic is straightforward, but understanding the context requires knowledge of the surrounding code.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It clearly combines the statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object into the current one. The variable names are descriptive and the method calls are straightforward. However, understanding the purpose of \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 and the variables \u0027simpleSum\u0027 and \u0027sumCompensation\u0027 requires some context or additional knowledge.","tokens":304,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It correctly handles the addition of months to the current month. The use of modulus to handle wrap-around is clear. However, the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and the method \u0027ordinal()\u0027 are not defined in this snippet, which could cause some confusion. Assuming they are properly defined elsewhere, the code is easy to understand.","tokens":284,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a clear conditional expression to return the average value. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 is meaningful, and the use of \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 suggests a clear understanding of the context. However, the lack of comments or Javadoc might make it harder for someone unfamiliar with the context to understand the purpose of \u0027media\u0027, \u0027contagem\u0027, and \u0027soma\u0027.","tokens":297,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
