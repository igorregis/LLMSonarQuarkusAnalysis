{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is poorly readable due to short variable names, lack of comments, and complex logic in a single method. It appears to be implementing the Luhn algorithm, but the variable names do not indicate their purpose.","tokens":468,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It correctly calculates the area of a triangle given base and height. Variable names are short but clear in context. Method name \u0027calc\u0027 is somewhat generic and could be more descriptive.","tokens":246,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is very concise but lacks clarity. Variable and method names are not descriptive and do not follow conventional Java naming conventions. The logic is not immediately clear without context about \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is very concise but lacks readability due to unclear variable and method names. \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, \u0027menta\u0027 do not convey their purpose or functionality, making it hard to understand the code\u0027s intent without additional context.","tokens":248,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It correctly calculates the area of a circle given the radius. However, it uses a hardcoded value for Pi instead of using Math.PI, which is more accurate and conventional. Variable names are simple and clear.","tokens":258,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to variable names being in Portuguese and not following conventional naming standards. The lack of comments and unclear variable names like \u0027coxa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027 make it hard to comprehend the code\u0027s purpose and logic.","tokens":488,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity due to unclear variable names. It uses a ternary operator, which is generally understood, but the overall meaning is obscured by the names getBrocolis, getEspinafre, and getJaca. Better naming would improve readability.","tokens":267,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally readable, but can be improved. The method name \u0027isAB\u0027 is not descriptive, and the variable \u0027a\u0027 could be more meaningful. The logic is correct but the if-else statement is redundant as it directly returns a boolean value. Simplification is possible.","tokens":285,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to the use of non-descriptive variable names such as gengibre, pimenta, batata, salsa, abobora, alecrim, berinjela, and others. The lack of clear and meaningful names makes it hard to comprehend the code\u0027s purpose and functionality.","tokens":323,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks clarity due to unclear variable names and missing context. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 and variable \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 do not indicate their purpose. The array \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, adding to the confusion. However, the logic is straightforward, suggesting a simple calculation and array access.","tokens":297,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
