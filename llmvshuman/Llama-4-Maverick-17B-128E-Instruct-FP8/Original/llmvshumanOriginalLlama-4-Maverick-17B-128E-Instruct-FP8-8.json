{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. The only improvement could be removing redundant comments that simply repeat what the code does.","tokens":344,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with a clear JavaDoc comment explaining the purpose and logic of the method. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly formatted. However, some improvements could be made, such as using more efficient data structures and reducing repetition in the code.","tokens":894,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese explaining the purpose and behavior of the method. The method name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive, and the logic is straightforward, using a simple arithmetic operation on an enum ordinal to determine the first month of the quarter.","tokens":370,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are descriptive, and the method is not too long. The use of comments in Portuguese explains the purpose of the method and some specific code sections. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the logic inside the loop is somewhat complex.","tokens":546,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The logic is straightforward, and the condition for checking a leap year is correctly implemented. However, the if-else statement is redundant and could be simplified by directly returning the boolean result of the condition.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. The only potential improvement could be adding comments to explain the \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 method\u0027s purpose, but its name is somewhat descriptive.","tokens":353,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, and return value. The method itself is simple and straightforward, making it easy to understand. The use of JavaDoc tags (@apiNote, @return) is proper and adds to the code\u0027s clarity.","tokens":374,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. However, using a hardcoded value for PI instead of Math.PI is not ideal, and some comments are redundant, as they simply repeat what the code does.","tokens":358,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and variable \u0027meses\u0027 are in Portuguese, matching the comments, and the logic is straightforward, making it easy to comprehend. However, the score is not 10 because it assumes the existence of another method \u0027soma\u0027 which is not shown here.","tokens":379,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear and concise Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is intuitive, and the logic is straightforward. The use of a descriptive variable name \u0027amount\u0027 and a clear calculation makes the code easy to understand. The only potential improvement could be adding a comment explaining the ENUMS array and its indexing, but overall, the code is self-explanatory.","tokens":403,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
