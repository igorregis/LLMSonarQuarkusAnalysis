{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with a clear JavaDoc comment explaining the purpose and logic of the method. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly formatted. However, some improvements could be made, such as using more efficient data structures and reducing repetition in the code.","tokens":894,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The logic is straightforward, and the condition for checking a leap year is correctly implemented. However, the if-else statement is redundant and could be simplified by directly returning the boolean result of the condition.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, and return value.

The use of JavaDoc tags (@apiNote, @return) is proper and adds to the code\u0027s readability.","tokens":374,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. The only potential improvement could be additional comments within the method to explain the purpose of \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 calls, but overall, the code is easy to comprehend.","tokens":359,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. However, using a hardcoded value for PI instead of Math.PI is not ideal, and some comments are redundant, as they simply repeat what the code does.","tokens":358,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese explaining the purpose and behavior of the method. The method name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive, and the logic is straightforward, using a simple mathematical operation to determine the first month of the quarter.
