{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with a clear JavaDoc comment explaining the purpose and logic of the method. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly formatted. However, some improvements could be made, such as using more efficient data structures and reducing repetition in the code.","tokens":894,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are descriptive, and the method is not too long. The use of comments in Portuguese explains the purpose of the method and some specific code sections. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the conditional statements could be simplified.","tokens":544,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. The logic is straightforward, and the condition for checking a leap year is correctly implemented. However, the if-else statement is redundant and could be simplified by directly returning the boolean result of the condition.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes a clear Javadoc comment explaining the method\u0027s purpose and parameters. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. The only potential improvement could be adding comments to explain the \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 method\u0027s purpose, but its name is somewhat descriptive.","tokens":353,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The variable names are descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The code could be further simplified by directly returning the result of the calculation, but overall, it is easy to comprehend.","tokens":352,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, behavior, and return value. The method itself is simple and straightforward, making it easy to comprehend. The use of JavaDoc tags (@apiNote, @return) is proper and adds to the code\u0027s readability.","tokens":374,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. However, using a hardcoded value for PI instead of Math.PI is not ideal, and some comments are redundant, as they simply repeat what the code does.","tokens":358,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise comments in Portuguese explaining the purpose and behavior of the method. The method name \u0027primeiroMesDoTrimestre\u0027 is descriptive, and the logic is straightforward, using a simple mathematical operation to determine the first month of the quarter. The variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, but its usage is clear.","tokens":385,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable due to clear and concise Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 and variable \u0027meses\u0027 are in Portuguese, matching the comments, and the logic is straightforward, making it easy to comprehend. However, the score is not 10 because it assumes knowledge of another method \u0027soma\u0027 which is not shown here.","tokens":378,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable. It includes clear and concise Javadoc comments explaining the method\u0027s purpose, parameters, and return value. The method name \u0027plus\u0027 is intuitive, and the logic is straightforward. The use of a clear and descriptive variable name \u0027amount\u0027 and the ENUMS array access makes the code easy to understand. The only potential improvement could be adding a comment explaining the ENUMS array, but overall, the code is self-explanatory.","tokens":404,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
