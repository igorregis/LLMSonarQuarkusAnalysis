{"score":"68","reasoning":"Code defines numerous empty classes inheriting from PythonStructural and Element or TextElement, organized with section comments for structural and inline elements. Consistent style and indentation aid readability, but duplicate class definitions like parameter_list, parameter_default, and class_attribute with varying base classes confuse comprehension without clear distinction.","tokens":1285,"name":"94.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The code uses simple, repetitive dictionary assignments in Python, making it highly readable and easy to comprehend. Consistent naming conventions and straightforward tuples/strings enhance clarity. Minor deductions for inconsistency between registry tuples and en.directives strings, plus absence of comments or grouping for better context.","tokens":1024,"name":"83.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code uses aligned assignments for easy scanning of color mappings. Functions are concise with docstrings explaining purpose. Clear intent for terminal colorization via dictionary lookups. Minor flaws: overwrites white key, typo fuscia, assumes prior codes dict population with hex and reset. Overall highly readable for Python developers.","tokens":1361,"name":"69.jsnp"}
{"score":"52","reasoning":"Code snippet has poor formatting with inconsistent indentation and leading spaces, mixing abrupt vector assignments with Python method. Repetitive if-elif chain for options lacks elegance. Incomplete comment and hardcoded bbox flip reduce clarity. Logic is simple but context-dependent on Inkscape library, making it hard for newcomers to comprehend fully.","tokens":1441,"name":"79.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Concise and idiomatic Python code. The else clause efficiently returns a new class instance using self.weekday and n. The __eq__ method uses try-except to safely compare weekday and n attributes, returning False on mismatch or AttributeError, which is clear and Pythonic. Easy to read despite being a snippet.","tokens":1001,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Well-structured Python class inheriting from CharSetProber with standard methods like init reset and feed. Logic follows state machine pattern clearly but uses non-Pythonic naming like aBuf aLen and m prefixed attributes. Feed loop is readable though imperative. Imports slightly redundant.

{"score":"82","reasoning":"Code is concise with clear function names and purposeful loops using pathdefs for param handling. formatPath uses elegant list comprehension. translate and scale are straightforward. rotatePath has inline math thats readable but assumes consecutive x y params without checks, slightly reducing clarity. Assumes global pathdefs and math import. Good comments aid comprehension.","tokens":1615,"name":"76.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Redundant imports of urllib modules twice hurt clarity. Verbose GPL license header adds noise though standard. Simple class with clear attributes but old-style object inheritance. Easy to comprehend overall despite duplication and incompleteness.","tokens":1119,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"45","reasoning":"Code purpose is understandable: processes symbols to generate PNG icons via LaTeX and dvipng, writes XML. However, readability is hindered by messy indentation, missing full function definitions, globals like retcode, hardcoded files like tmp and xmlsample, unsafe subprocess.Popen with split, outdated print syntax, no imports or comments, and basic error handling via prints.","tokens":1329,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Excellent readability with clear docstring explaining purpose and behavior. Logical flow: checks for commas first to quote, then spaces to decide delimiter. Good variable names like use_commas and glue. Minor deductions for Python 2-style unicode prefixes (u) and old % formatting, but code is concise, maintainable, and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1241,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Code structure is clear with logical use of set intersections and unions for filtering. Variable names are descriptive. However, reliance on undefined private attributes like self.__categories, use of eval which is unsafe and unclear without context, redundant recursive child expansion in static method, and apparent indentation inconsistencies hinder full comprehension.","tokens":1662,"name":"95.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Code is simple and linear: class wraps VirtualBox controller with basic methods, then loops to start VM 100 times with short sleep to reproduce lockup. Positives: clear purpose from comment, straightforward structure. Issues: many unused attributes, nics as string, no error handling or stops between starts, old print style. Readable for Python devs familiar with API, but could be cleaner without class overhead.","tokens":1365,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"Code snippet from Python import machinery is clear and logical, with proper error handling for relative imports, descriptive docstring, and straightforward variable names. Minor deductions for Python 2 syntax like xrange and old string formatting, plus snippet starts mid-function affecting context slightly, but overall highly readable and comprehensible for experienced developers.","tokens":1096,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"98","reasoning":"The code is a simple Python dictionary defining German translations for Docutils labels. It features clear structure, consistent formatting, self-explanatory keys and values, and minimal syntax. Highly readable and easy to comprehend, with only a minor detached docstring at the end that does not impact understanding.","tokens":1003,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with descriptive test method names, clear variable names like noonish and midweek, and consistent assertion patterns. Tests are self-explanatory for date time utilities. Minor deductions for exception handling in first test which is slightly indirect, pragma no cover comments, and assumption of custom date.DateTime class without context.","tokens":1533,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Code is straightforward Python script with clear imports and error handling. Main logic for image sizing based on page dimensions is easy to follow.

{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with clear license header, simple import, and a well-structured list of tuples for snooze options using descriptive translations and consistent minute calculations. Minor deduction for incomplete list missing closing bracket, making it syntactically invalid, but intent is easily comprehensible.","tokens":1190,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"Code snippet implements Code39 barcode encoding with a clear char-to-binary mapping dictionary and encode method that adds start/stop markers, handles unknown chars, appends inter-char gaps, and generates alternating wide/narrow bars. Strengths: logical flow and purpose evident from comments. Weaknesses: typos like isposible, inconsistent spacing and indentation, inefficient string concatenation in loops, outdated has_key method, informal comments. Comprehensible to experienced developers but needs polishing for high readability.","tokens":1719,"name":"75.jsnp"}
