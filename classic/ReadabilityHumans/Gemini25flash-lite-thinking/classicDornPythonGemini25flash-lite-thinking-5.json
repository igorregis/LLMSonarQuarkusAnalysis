{"score":"98","reasoning":"The code defines a clear and concise custom exception class. Its name is descriptive, and the docstring effectively explains its purpose and provides a useful doctest example. This makes it highly readable and easy to comprehend for any Python developer.","tokens":1147,"name":"70.jsnp"}
{"score":"68","reasoning":"The code exhibits a structured object-oriented design with descriptive method names. However, the core feed method\u0027s logic for state transitions and character handling is complex and difficult to follow quickly. The management of _mLastChar and its interaction with _mDistributionAnalyzer is intricate. Additionally, get_charset_name is a placeholder, indicating incomplete implementation. Reliance on external modules also limits full context.","tokens":2494,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"40","reasoning":"The code maps characters to binary strings for barcode encoding. The encoding dictionary is clear. However, it uses deprecated Python 2 syntax has_key and inefficient string concatenation in loops. Comments are unhelpful and contain typos. The class name Object is too generic. The logic for generating barcode patterns is present but could be more readable.","tokens":2533,"name":"75.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear and descriptive docstrings explaining the purpose of these placeholder methods. The method names are intuitive. The use of pass is a standard Python idiom for abstract or template methods, making the intent immediately clear. Comprehension is excellent for this snippet.","tokens":1150,"name":"66.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is clear and idiomatic Python. The equality method robustly compares attributes and handles potential AttributeError exceptions gracefully making it easy to comprehend.","tokens":1018,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its excellent docstring and clear variable names. The logic for handling tag names with commas and whitespace is straightforward and correctly implemented. The use of glue.join(names) is idiomatic Python. The only minor point is the unnecessary u prefix for string literals in Python 3.","tokens":1537,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear variable names like pending component_type and format. The class and method docstrings are exceptionally detailed and provide a clear explanation of the transform\u0027s purpose and usage with a helpful example. The logic within the apply method is straightforward and easy to follow, leveraging the docutils framework effectively. The structure is standard for a Python class. The snippet is concise and directly addresses its task. The abrupt ending of the else block is noted but does not significantly hinder comprehension of the presented logic.","tokens":2173,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"Excellent structure and dependency error handling using try-except blocks. The logic is clear and easy to follow. Variable names are generally descriptive, with minor potential for reduced universal readability due to German terms like Breite and Hoehe. The header comment is informative.","tokens":1935,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code implements relative import resolution using string manipulation and older Python 2 syntax like xrange. While functional and with clear docstrings, the logic for finding the correct package path with rindex can be dense. Modern Python offers more abstract ways to handle imports.","tokens":1642,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is straightforward with clear variable names and a simple class structure. However, a duplicate import statement for the urllib module is present, which detracts from its cleanliness. The extensive license header, while standard, adds considerable non-code text. The core logic is minimal and easy to understand.","tokens":1512,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a class and descriptive method names. However, the initialization of some attributes in the constructor, such as nics set to \u00276\u0027, lacks immediate context making it less clear without external knowledge of the VirtualBox API. The loops specific purpose is implied by an initial comment but not fully self-evident from the code itself.","tokens":1939,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear comments and docstrings explaining its purpose and origin. Variable and function names are appropriate for a test suite context. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with a simple and direct test case definition. It adheres to good Python practices for clarity and maintainability.","tokens":1323,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code uses Python 2 print syntax and older string formatting which reduces readability for modern developers. A missing quote in the URL is a functional error. The undefined listPath function means the snippet is incomplete. However, the core logic of iterating and filtering directories is clear.","tokens":1417,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code presents well-organized unit tests with highly descriptive method names. Variable names are clear and the logic within each test is straightforward, making it easy to understand the intended behavior being verified. Assertions clearly indicate expected outcomes. The structure and naming conventions contribute to excellent readability and comprehension.","tokens":2220,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear variable naming and a well-structured dictionary for mappings. Its purpose of providing German language translations for document labels is immediately obvious. The docstrings are informative. The placement of the second docstring is slightly unconventional but does not impede comprehension.","tokens":1461,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code exhibits good readability with descriptive variable names clear comments and proper docstrings. It adheres to standard Python and GUI practices. The Clone method is well implemented. The initial incomplete line is a minor detraction preventing full evaluation of that specific segment.","tokens":1708,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"The variable name is descriptive and the list structure is clear. The use of internationalization is good. However, the code snippet is syntactically incomplete, ending with a dangling comma, which prevents it from being evaluated as functional code and impacts overall comprehension.","tokens":1627,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code uses standard Django ORM syntax making it generally readable. Field names are descriptive. However, the Perch model definition is incomplete. The use of the deprecated __unicode__ method instead of __str__ is a minor readability issue for modern codebases. Overall comprehension is good for developers familiar with Django.","tokens":1741,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code employs clear naming conventions and Pythonic constructs such as context managers. Imports are well organized. However, its reliance on deprecated modules like cPickle and cStringIO and Python 2 syntax slightly impacts modern readability.","tokens":1729,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with descriptive names and clear test cases. Helper methods enhance readability. It follows standard Python testing practices, making it easy to understand the logic and purpose of each test. The use of lambdas for mocking is appropriate.","tokens":1269,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code has some clear sections like file copying and logging. However, it suffers from modifying a dictionary during iteration in the first loop a significant readability and correctness issue. It also uses outdated Python 2 syntax like print and file(). The relinkOld function is confusing with commented shell script and a pass statement. Variable names are mostly adequate.","tokens":2358,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"This script is highly readable due to clear function definitions and a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose and potential pitfalls. Excellent error handling for missing dependencies is provided with user-friendly messages. The use of global is minor for a demo and explained. Python 2 exception syntax is present but understandable.","tokens":1931,"name":"108.jsnp"}
