{"score":"88","reasoning":"The code uses clear variable assignments and descriptive keys making it easy to understand. It employs simple data structures and lacks complex logic. Some redundancy exists in the en.directives assignments where keys and values are identical. Context for \u0027en\u0027 and \u0027EffDirectives\u0027 is not provided.","tokens":1371,"name":"83.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear docstrings explaining the purpose of these placeholder methods for handling hierarchy levels. The use of \u0027pass\u0027 is standard for abstract methods, and the naming is descriptive. Comprehension is straightforward.","tokens":893,"name":"66.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The __eq__ method provides a clear and robust comparison by checking relevant attributes and handling potential AttributeErrors for type mismatches. The use of self.__class__ is idiomatic Python. Overall, the code is concise and easy to comprehend.","tokens":1233,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to clear variable names and an excellent docstring explaining complex formatting rules. The logic for handling commas and spaces is straightforward. Minor point: use of u\u0027\u0027 prefix is dated for Python 3 but does not hinder comprehension significantly.","tokens":1417,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code features clear variable names and an exceptionally detailed docstring that thoroughly explains its functionality and purpose. However, the \u0027else\u0027 block in the apply method is incomplete, rendering the code syntactically incorrect and its behavior undefined in that crucial branch, significantly hindering overall comprehension and usability.","tokens":1705,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"Informative header comments and robust error handling for external libraries enhance comprehension. The code structure is clear with a main function. The logic for calculating dimensions is straightforward. However, the use of German variable names like Breite and Hoehe slightly reduces universal readability for a global audience.","tokens":2292,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"The code implements relative import resolution. _import_module is clear with good comments. _resolve_name logic is functional but uses less descriptive variable names like \u0027dot\u0027 and \u0027x\u0027 making it slightly dense. Overall comprehension is good.","tokens":1473,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is simple and uses clear variable names. The class structure is easy to follow. Minor redundancy in urllib imports slightly reduces clarity. Extensive license header is standard but adds non-code text.","tokens":1359,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with a clear class definition and descriptive method names. The purpose is evident from the initial comment. It\u0027s easy to follow the VM operations. Minor improvements could include removing unused initialized variables and using standard newlines instead of os.linesep for better conciseness.","tokens":1934,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and standard Python conventions. Docstrings and header comments enhance readability. The test data format is straightforward. Minor incompleteness of the snippet does not detract from the clarity of the provided code.","tokens":1380,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code logic is clear for finding release directories. However it uses Python 2 print syntax and string formatting which reduces readability for modern Python developers. A significant bug exists with a missing quote in the HTML link. It also depends on an undefined function listPath.","tokens":1469,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The DateTimeTest class is highly readable with clear method names descriptive variables and straightforward assertions The PyDateTimeTest class has one test with confusing comments and unusual pragma usage but its underlying logic is sound Overall the code is easy to comprehend","tokens":3131,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is highly readable due to its simple dictionary structure and clear naming conventions. The purpose of mapping English terms to German translations for Docutils is immediately evident from the docstring and variable name. Keys and values are descriptive and well-formatted, making comprehension effortless. Minimal complexity contributes to its ease of understanding.","tokens":1109,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code snippet uses descriptive variable names and includes clear docstrings for the class and its methods. The structure is logical and follows common Python patterns for GUI art classes. Although incomplete, the visible parts are easy to understand.","tokens":1428,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The code defines a clear list of snooze options. Variable names are descriptive. The structure of tuples (value, label) is intuitive. Internationalization is handled. Some values use multiplication for clarity (e.g. 3*60 for 3 hours), which is understandable. The formatting aids readability.","tokens":1707,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The Django model definitions for Parrot Link and Article are clear well-structured and follow standard conventions Field names are descriptive and methods like unicode are correctly implemented However the initial lines size and smelly are out of context and incomplete which detracts from overall coherence and correctness","tokens":1807,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"Good import organization and clear naming. Uses standard Python idioms like context managers and callable objects. Helper classes are well-defined. Readability is slightly impacted by heavy reliance on external libraries (docutils) and project-specific modules, requiring context for full comprehension. Note Python 2 syntax used.","tokens":1842,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with descriptive names and clear test cases. Helper methods enhance readability. It follows standard Python testing patterns. Comprehension is high for its intended purpose, assuming familiarity with wxPython and the application context.","tokens":1347,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code modifies a dictionary while iterating over it, a common error source. It also uses Python 2 print statements and the file() constructor. While logic for copying and logging is understandable, the dictionary modification significantly harms readability and correctness.","tokens":2090,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code features a clear structure good docstrings and dependency error handling. However the main function is defined but never called making the script non-executable and its runtime behavior unclear.
