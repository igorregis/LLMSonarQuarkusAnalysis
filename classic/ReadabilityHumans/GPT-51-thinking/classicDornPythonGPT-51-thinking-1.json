{"score":"85","reasoning":"The snippet is highly readable due to clear concise docstrings and a very simple structure. Method naming communicates intent and there is no complex logic to parse. Readability is slightly reduced because the snippet is incomplete and lacks the surrounding class and the first method definition, which makes the context a bit unclear.","tokens":927,"name":"66.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Clear docstring and intent, simple loop and conditionals, descriptive names and straightforward join logic. Minor dated unicode usage and small branching could be slightly simplified, but overall readability and comprehension are very high.","tokens":802,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Simple structure and clear control flow. Imports handled with basic error messages. Indentation and spacing are consistent. Readability is reduced by wildcard import and mixed language variable names, and there is little commenting or structure beyond a short main function.","tokens":981,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"82","reasoning":"Readable header and simple data structure with clear snoozeChoices tuples and consistent use of the translation function. Naming is understandable and the minutes to hours mapping via multiplication is easy to follow. Minor issues include the incomplete snippet without a closing bracket and slightly uneven line formatting, but overall comprehension remains straightforward.","tokens":1028,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Readable mapping of colors and helper functions with clear naming and structure Consistent formatting and simple logic aid comprehension Minor issues are the redefinition of white potential confusion from similar color aliases and lack of context on codes initialization Overall easy to follow","tokens":1449,"name":"69.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"Code is short, well indented, and the purpose of the test class and its configuration is easy to infer. Attribute names are descriptive and arguments are clearly laid out. Readability is slightly reduced by the nonstandard class name style and the missing visible import or definition for dbapi20, which may momentarily confuse readers.","tokens":807,"name":"52.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"Code is short and structured, with clear class and method names and consistent style, making behavior easy to follow. However it lacks comments and docstrings, uses older Python 2 specific modules and relies on side effect imports, which slightly reduces immediate clarity for unfamiliar readers.","tokens":1317,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"98","reasoning":"Very clear and concise mapping in a small dictionary with descriptive keys and values and minimal boilerplate The structure is straightforward and easy to follow with consistent formatting and no complex logic making comprehension almost immediate","tokens":889,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Readable and well structured unit test code with clear method and variable names, small focused tests and straightforward setup and assertions. Lacks comments or docstrings and uses some magic string values for icons but overall still very easy to follow.","tokens":1155,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"Readable unit test methods with clear intentions and consistent structure. Naming is mostly descriptive and logic flow is straightforward. Minor issues are mixed naming conventions and potential confusion between task and self.task, but overall the code is easy to understand and maintain.","tokens":871,"name":"56.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"Code is short and well structured, with a clear docstring, simple flow, and descriptive function names. Exception handling for missing dependencies is explicit and user oriented. Readability is good overall, but it relies on outdated Python 2 and older PyQt signal syntax, and the main guard appears incomplete.","tokens":1122,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"82","reasoning":"Code is short and clearly structured with meaningful names and simple control flow, making it easy to follow. However, it lacks comments and error handling, uses legacy print syntax, and the HTML anchor string is malformed, which slightly reduces clarity and overall readability.","tokens":1056,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"Code is fairly readable with clear variable names and linear control flow. However, the initial sanitizing block appears outside a proper function definition, run_command uses globals, there is no error handling around file access, and hardcoded temp names and Python 2 style prints reduce clarity.","tokens":1431,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Simple uniform class declarations and clear section comments make the code easy to skim. Names are descriptive. Readability is reduced by duplicate class names with different base types and the lack of docstrings or context about how these placeholder classes are intended to be used.","tokens":1176,"name":"94.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"Variable names are clear and logic is simple, but the snippet lacks visible function definition and imports, uses Python 2 print syntax, and the presented indentation and spacing are not explicit, which reduces readability and makes the overall intent less immediately clear.","tokens":945,"name":"86.jsnp"}
{"score":"86","reasoning":"Readable Python with clear structure, descriptive function names, and helpful messages. Indentation and flow are straightforward, though while else usage is a bit uncommon and bare except hides error details. Minor style issues, but overall easy to follow.","tokens":2314,"name":"53.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"Code is concise and follows Django conventions. Class and field names are meaningful and ordering meta aids understanding. Indentation and structure are clear. However, missing class context for the initial fields and absence of comments or docstrings slightly reduce overall readability.","tokens":988,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Readable Python code with clear control flow, helpful step comments and understandable variable names. Logic for iterating fixes and executables is straightforward. However it lacks docstrings and structured error handling, mixes printing and logging, uses legacy Python 2 constructs and hard coded paths, which slightly reduces overall clarity and maintainability.","tokens":1494,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear constant names and simple well structured functions. Use of wx system colors is straightforward and logic is easy to follow. Minor issues include a function named like a constant, some inconsistent spacing and alignment, and lack of docstrings, but these do not significantly hurt comprehension.","tokens":1104,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is short and logically organized, with a clear docstring, descriptive function names, and straightforward control flow. Indentation and spacing are consistent, and user messages explain behavior. Readability is high; minor issues are the use of a global variable, outdated Python 2 style, and the truncated main guard.","tokens":1215,"name":"108.jsnp"}
