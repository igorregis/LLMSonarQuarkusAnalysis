External dependencies slightly reduce standalone clarity, and there are no comments or docstrings, but overall readability and comprehension are high.","tokens":773,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is concise and clearly structured, with meaningful names and straightforward logic. Test data is small and localized, and the suite function is easy to follow. Understanding the external test framework may require context, but overall readability and comprehension are high.","tokens":941,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Clear structure and naming, comprehensive docstrings, and standard Python style make the code easy to follow. Use of pending details is well documented. Indentation and layout are consistent. Minor issue is the unfinished else block, which slightly disrupts comprehension but not overall readability.","tokens":1169,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code is easy to understand thanks to a descriptive variable name and a clear pattern mapping minutes to labels. Use of tuples and localization wrapper is straightforward. Formatting is mostly consistent, though the line is long, quote styles are mixed, and the snippet ends abruptly, which slightly hurts readability.","tokens":1137,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Simple and short code, class and attributes are clear, naming is meaningful and imports are standard. Redundant duplicate urllib import slightly reduces clarity, and there are no docstrings or comments about intended behavior beyond the license header. Overall still very easy to read.","tokens":949,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"94","reasoning":"Descriptive test method and variable names make intent clear. Structure is simple and consistent, using standard unittest patterns. DateTime usage and expectations are explicit and easy to follow. Very readable overall, with minor possible improvements like adding docstrings or aligning to PEP8 spacing conventions.","tokens":1520,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Clear Python function with descriptive name and detailed docstring. Variable names are meaningful and logic is straightforward with minimal nesting. Use of Unicode prefixes is slightly outdated and glue selection could be more compact, but overall readability and comprehension are excellent.","tokens":1170,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"Readable Python with consistent indentation and descriptive method and attribute names. Logic in feed is linear and easy to follow. However there are no comments or docstrings and state machine behavior is implicit. Use of short variable names and magic values slightly reduces clarity.","tokens":1422,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"74","reasoning":"Code uses consistent indentation and clear branching on copy modes making the control flow easy to follow However mathematical lines with v vx vy dx dy are terse and lack comments and there are minor style inconsistencies in spacing and naming but overall it remains reasonably understandable","tokens":1121,"name":"79.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Readable Python snippet with clear class and method names, concise docstrings and consistent indentation. Logic is straightforward and follows wxPython conventions. Minor context missing from the surrounding code and some operations rely on external helpers, but overall comprehension is easy.","tokens":911,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Code structure is clear with logical steps and comments, and variable names are mostly descriptive so the control flow is easy to follow. Indentation and spacing are acceptable, though the legacy Python 2 style, lack of explicit error handling, and minimal explanation of some operations slightly reduce readability. Overall it is moderately easy to read and understand.","tokens":1247,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"86","reasoning":"Code is short and well structured, with a simple class and methods that match their purpose, and indentation is consistent. Variable names are mostly clear, though some like vbc or nics are less descriptive. Heavy reliance on external modules and a hardcoded vm name slightly reduce overall clarity.","tokens":1331,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"99","reasoning":"Very clear and concise mapping definition with descriptive variable name and straightforward key value pairs, minimal syntax, and helpful module and mapping descriptions. No complex logic or nesting, so it is immediately understandable and easy to maintain.","tokens":1139,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Code structure is linear and variable names are clear, making flow easy to follow. However it lacks spacing and modern constructs, uses global state and minimal error handling, and mixes concerns in main loop, which reduces clarity.","tokens":1636,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code is short, well structured and uses clear constant names. Functions are simple with descriptive names and straightforward logic. Minor issues include misleading constant style for callable SCHEDULER_BACKGROUND_BRUSH and DAY_BACKGROUND_BRUSH, alignment via tabs, and duplicated TODAY vs TO_DAY names, but overall readability is high.","tokens":1010,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Django model definitions are concise and consistent, field and class names are clear, ordering meta aids understanding. Minor issue with the initial fragment lacking its class declaration and limited comments or docstrings, but overall structure is straightforward and easy to follow.","tokens":791,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is short and well structured, with clear functions, comments and docstring explaining behavior. Naming is descriptive and control flow is easy to follow. Use of a global timer and older Python syntax may slightly hinder understanding, and the missing main call at the end reduces clarity a bit, but overall readability is high.","tokens":1365,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Imports are well organized and names are descriptive, aiding readability. Helper classes relpath_to and collect_env_warnings are concise and use clear patterns like context managers. However, there are no docstrings or comments, use of side effect imports may confuse, and Python 2 specific constructs slightly reduce clarity.","tokens":1116,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Clear structure and intent, helpful top comment and descriptive names make the script easy to follow. Use of try except for dependency checks is readable. Minor drawbacks are outdated Python 2 style syntax and that the main guard does not call main, which slightly reduces completeness but not understanding.","tokens":1354,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"82","reasoning":"Two clear string cases showing input and expected output, indentation is consistent and structure is easy to follow. Readability is good for someone familiar with reStructuredText and testing patterns. However, escape tricks in multiline strings and lack of broader context slightly reduce overall clarity.","tokens":1801,"name":"110.jsnp"}
