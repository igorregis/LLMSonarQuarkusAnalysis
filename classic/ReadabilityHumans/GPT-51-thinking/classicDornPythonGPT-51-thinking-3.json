Minor issues include this being an incomplete snippet and a few small formatting irregularities.","tokens":787,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Code is highly readable with clear test setup, teardown, and helper method. Variable and method names are descriptive and convey intent well. Test cases are short and focused. Minor issues include slightly long lines and lack of docstrings or comments, but overall comprehension is straightforward and structure is clean.","tokens":796,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"Mapping and loop logic are clear and variable names are understandable though comments have typos and English issues. Use of deprecated has_key poor class name Object and missing explicit return reduce clarity. Formatting is mostly consistent but final encoded value handling is not shown.","tokens":1394,"name":"75.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Readable Python with clear intent, good naming and thorough documentation. Follows consistent style and simple control flow, making it easy to understand. Minor issues include use of format as a variable name and the truncated else block which slightly reduces immediate comprehension.","tokens":1241,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"The snippet is easy to understand because of clear, focused docstrings and a descriptive method name. The behavior is simple with pass placeholders inviting overrides. Readability is slightly reduced by the leading docstring appearing without its corresponding def, which may momentarily confuse readers about structure.","tokens":965,"name":"66.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"Readability is high due to clear test case structure, meaningful method and variable names, and simple logic. Indentation and formatting are consistent. However context is partially missing for some referenced classes and methods, and there are no docstrings or comments, which slightly reduces overall clarity.","tokens":2156,"name":"9.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Clear structure and naming, short class with simple methods and helpful docstrings. Consistent formatting and low complexity make it easy to understand, though get_chassis returning an empty string and platform set via a literal slightly reduce clarity.","tokens":1479,"name":"78.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Code is mostly readable with clear control flow and consistent indentation. Descriptive option attributes help understanding. Boolean flag handling repeats logic, spacing around operators and assignments is inconsistent, and short math variable names reduce clarity for new readers.","tokens":1557,"name":"79.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is concise and follows standard Django model conventions, with clear class and field names and simple unicode methods, making it easy to read and understand. Meta ordering is consistently applied. The only minor drawback is that the initial size and smelly fields appear without surrounding class context, which can slightly hinder immediate comprehension.","tokens":784,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"Readable code with clear naming, comments and docstrings. Control flow is straightforward and split into small functions. Indentation and spacing are consistent. Some nesting and the use of a bare except and the outdated has_key method slightly hurt clarity, but overall it is easy to understand.","tokens":1827,"name":"53.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code is mostly clear with well named constants and simple helper functions. Indentation and spacing are decent, though naming functions like constants is slightly confusing and comments and docstrings are minimal. Overall it is easy to follow and understand.","tokens":990,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Code is short and structured with a clear class and simple delegation to controller methods. Variable and method names are mostly descriptive. Lack of docstrings and comments, use of abbreviations like vbc and mgr, and hard coded values for vmname and nics slightly reduce readability.","tokens":1373,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"68","reasoning":"Code is mostly linear and easy to follow, with clear intent and simple control flow. Function and variable names are understandable, and progress messages help comprehension. However, missing function definition context, heavy reliance on globals, sparse comments, and some magic strings reduce overall readability.","tokens":1621,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code is short and well structured, with clear docstring and straightforward flow. Error handling shows intent and message texts explain context. Naming is mostly clear and indentation consistent. Use of Python 2 style exceptions and a global variable slightly reduce clarity, but overall readability remains high.","tokens":1298,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Very readable Python snippet with a single list of snooze options, clear naming and repetitive tuple structure, plus a standard license header. Minor issues are the long line of list elements and that the snippet appears truncated at the end, but overall comprehension is straightforward.","tokens":1300,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"83","reasoning":"Indentation and structure are clear, logic is straightforward, and conditionals are easy to follow. Minor readability issues include generic variable names like name and fname, embedding markup in print calls, and the special case check path not equal dot that lacks clarification or a named constant.","tokens":1274,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"The code is clean and mostly consistent. Imports and helper classes are well named and responsibilities are clear, making flow easy to grasp. Older Python 2 idioms and absence of comments or docstrings slightly hurt clarity, and understanding relative imports depends on wider project context, but overall readability is good.","tokens":1381,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"82","reasoning":"Code is short and linear, with clear control flow and well named variables and functions. Inline comments outline each step, making behavior understandable. Readability is lowered by legacy Python2 style, minimal error handling, mixing print statements with logging, and absence of docstrings or explicit structure for the log content.","tokens":1707,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"82","reasoning":"Code is clean and follows common Python style with clear names and helpful error messages. Docstring explains purpose of import helper. Logic for resolving relative names is slightly dense and relies on index math which may need extra thought, but still manageable. Overall readability is above average.","tokens":1214,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"Clear control flow and consistent style, descriptive class and method names, and good use of helper objects make the code fairly easy to follow. However, lack of comments or docstrings, cryptic variable names like aBuf and aLen, and heavy reliance on external state reduce readability somewhat.","tokens":1495,"name":"4.jsnp"}
