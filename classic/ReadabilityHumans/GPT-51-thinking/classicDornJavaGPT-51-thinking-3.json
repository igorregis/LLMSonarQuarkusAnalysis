Minor issues include the typo in _proccessAttributes, use of raw Collections.EMPTY_LIST, and underscored private method names, which slightly reduce overall clarity and modern Java best practices.","tokens":1060,"name":"211.jsnp"}
{"score":"96","reasoning":"The code is highly readable with clear class and method names, simple logic, and standard Java formatting. Methods are short and self explanatory. The hasError method is slightly verbose but still clear. Overall structure is minimal and easy to understand, with no complex control flow or obscure constructs.","tokens":1013,"name":"163.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"Code is very short and straightforward with clear class and field names and standard Java formatting, making it easy to read. However, the snippet is incomplete, fields lack explicit access modifiers, and there is no documentation or methods to convey intent, which slightly reduces overall clarity and self descriptiveness.","tokens":594,"name":"128.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Code is mostly readable with clear indentation and simple control flow. Variable naming for the loop counter conveys intent. However, infinite for loops with break, a magic timeout value, repeated long XPath literals, and an empty catch block hurt clarity. The final loop appears incomplete, slightly reducing overall comprehensibility.","tokens":1703,"name":"113.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"Code is very readable with clear class and method naming, consistent indentation, and concise logic. Javadoc comments accurately describe behavior and parameters. Control flow is straightforward and there is no unnecessary complexity. Minor improvement could be stronger type usage for Enumeration with generics, but overall clarity is excellent.","tokens":738,"name":"122.jsnp"}
{"score":"87","reasoning":"The code is readable with consistent formatting, clear method names and parameters, and logical grouping of related operations. Use of annotations improves understanding. Readability is slightly reduced by very long fully qualified type names and repeated checked exceptions, which make method signatures verbose.","tokens":1263,"name":"144.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Code is clear and well structured, with consistent naming and straightforward null handling. StringBundler usage for building the string output is explicit and easy to follow. There is some verbosity due to repetitive append calls and null checks, but overall readability and comprehension are high.","tokens":1094,"name":"197.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is easy to read with clear test method names, simple linear steps and meaningful assertion use. Formatting and spacing are consistent and there is no complex logic. Some context is missing for helper methods and the last method appears truncated, slightly reducing overall clarity.","tokens":1392,"name":"120.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Code is clear and easy to follow, with descriptive names, straightforward control flow, and good use of logging. Indentation and structure aid readability. Minor issues are the verbose string concatenation for logging and the unimplemented methods throwing UnsupportedOperationException without documentation, but they do not hurt comprehension much.","tokens":759,"name":"154.jsnp"}
{"score":"93","reasoning":"Clean and consistent Java wrapper class, easy to follow. Method names are clear and delegate directly to the underlying AuthToken, and the setAuthToken logic is simple. Indentation and formatting are standard. The snippet omits field declarations and comments, but this does not significantly harm readability or comprehension.","tokens":1016,"name":"139.jsnp"}
{"score":"72","reasoning":"Variable names and structure are mostly clear, indentation is consistent and the general flow can be understood. However, the label and switch pattern used to control looping hurts readability, magic numbers reduce clarity, and exceptions are swallowed without explanation. Overall it is reasonably readable but not very idiomatic or clean.","tokens":1189,"name":"205.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code is concise and follows standard Java test style. Naming and indentation are clear, and the wait loop logic is easy to follow. Minimal noise and consistent structure aid comprehension, though the use of magic numbers and an empty catch block slightly reduce clarity. Overall readability and understanding are high.","tokens":1289,"name":"219.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Simple and clear Java snippet with consistent indentation and descriptive naming. Control flow is straightforward and the exception message aids debugging. Limited context but locally very readable.","tokens":712,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"Code is well structured and indented, uses descriptive names and clear control flow. Waiting loop pattern is recognizable though somewhat verbose, and empty catch reduces clarity. Overall the snippet is easy to follow despite being incomplete.","tokens":1037,"name":"203.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Simple, well-indented Java snippet; variable and method names are descriptive and the control flow is straightforward. Early null check avoids extra nesting and makes intent clear. Only minor style issues like redundant parentheses and somewhat inconsistent spacing, but overall readability and comprehension are very high.","tokens":787,"name":"185.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Readable Java interface methods with clear parameter types and descriptive names. Consistent formatting and exceptions declared. Minor inconsistency between getURLView and getUrlTitle naming and lack of context or comments reduce clarity slightly.","tokens":1030,"name":"195.jsnp"}
{"score":"62","reasoning":"Indentation and control flow are clear and operations follow a linear sequence so logic can be followed However readability is hurt by long hardcoded xpath strings numeric indices magic constants and duplicated wait loops with no helper methods or comments Score reflects moderate clarity","tokens":2564,"name":"194.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"Readability is high with consistent Java style, clear getter methods and descriptive names. The toString and toShortString methods are slightly dense because of long string concatenations and the use of a magic number for truncation, but the intent is still clear and the code remains easy to follow overall.","tokens":1030,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"Clear, minimal interface with descriptive method names and helpful JavaDoc comments, making intent easy to understand. Structure is straightforward and domain concepts are evident. Readability is slightly reduced by the raw Map type without generics and the missing closing brace in the snippet, but overall comprehension remains high.","tokens":996,"name":"216.jsnp"}
{"score":"86","reasoning":"The snippet is short and the logic is straightforward. Variable and method names like testEmailChecked and clickAt convey purpose clearly. Indentation is acceptable. However, label is a magic number whose role is unclear, and the code appears to be a fragment, which slightly reduces overall readability and context.","tokens":849,"name":"129.jsnp"}
