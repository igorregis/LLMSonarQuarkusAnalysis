{"score":"88","reasoning":"Code snippet is short and well-structured with clear descriptive naming conventions for exported functions. The comment provides useful context despite minor typo. Import statement is standard. Non-standard ordering of __all__ before imports and slightly unusual tuple formatting are minor issues. Overall highly readable and easy to comprehend for target audience familiar with Python module conventions.","tokens":1741,"name":"118.jsnp"}
{"score":"40","reasoning":"Code uses cryptic single-letter variables and magic indices like defs[1] and defs[3][i] without explanation. Heavy reliance on external context pathdefs structure and SVG domain knowledge. Dense list comprehension in formatPath is hard to parse. Functions modify parameters in-place unexpectedly. Lacks type hints and clear documentation. While functions are short and focused, overall comprehension requires significant external knowledge making it difficult to read and maintain.","tokens":2041,"name":"76.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"Exception class with clear, descriptive naming. Docstring effectively explains purpose in concurrency context and includes practical doctest demonstrating exception hierarchy. Code is minimal, focused, and follows Python conventions. Immediately understandable.","tokens":1516,"name":"70.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"Multiple undefined dictionary references create KeyError risks. Values are overwritten inconsistently. Essential keys like reset and bold are missing. No comments explain intent. Global state mutation in nocolor() is poor practice. Repetitive structure is error-prone. Functional issues severely hinder comprehension despite simple syntax.","tokens":2244,"name":"69.jsnp"}
{"score":"88","reasoning":"Concise test configuration class with clear purpose. Descriptive attribute names and clean dictionary formatting enhance readability. Minor deductions for non-PEP8 class name test_MySQLdb and absence of docstring or comments. Missing dbapi20 import may confuse unfamiliar readers. Overall simple structure and easy to comprehend.","tokens":2000,"name":"52.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"Clear structure with good naming docstrings and comments. Uses multiple inheritance appropriately. Methods are concise. However get_chassis method is confusing returning empty string after assertion. Dependencies on parent classes create_config and default_symbol are not obvious. Readable for those familiar with the codebase but some implementation details lack clarity.","tokens":2398,"name":"78.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"Code has major readability issues: missing function definition with misleading docstring, heavy use of global variables, outdated Python 2 syntax, no error handling, missing imports, fragile command splitting, and poor modularity. The flow is understandable but maintenance would be difficult due to scattered logic and lack of structure.","tokens":1579,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"32","reasoning":"Non-Pythonic naming with _m and a prefixes reduces clarity. Cryptic constants like eItsMe and eError require external context. Complex buffer slicing logic in feed() is hard to follow, especially _mLastChar manipulation. Incomplete get_charset_name() method is confusing. Heavy reliance on unseen components (CharSetProber, constants) without type hints makes comprehension difficult. Overall structure suggests a state machine but lacks documentation.","tokens":2161,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"87","reasoning":"Excellent docstring clearly explains purpose and mechanism with concrete example. Good variable naming and simple control flow enhance readability. Code is incomplete (truncated else block) which slightly impacts comprehension. Requires framework-specific knowledge but documentation mitigates this well. Overall very readable for its domain.","tokens":1571,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"Inconsistent formatting uses tabs after names and excessive whitespace. Mixed naming conventions across constants and functions hurt clarity. Functions lack separation and duplicate code. Magic number 15 is unexplained. The TO_DAY vs TODAY distinction is ambiguous. Despite being short and having a helpful comment, these issues significantly impact readability.","tokens":2231,"name":"29.jsnp"}
{"score":"45","reasoning":"The snippet contains an incomplete first method missing its definition header, which severely impacts comprehension. Docstrings improperly use single quotes instead of triple double quotes per PEP 8.

While functional the code requires extra effort to comprehend due to missing surrounding code and unclear variable scope.","tokens":1651,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"Good docstring clearly explains purpose and edge cases. Function and variable names are descriptive. Logic is straightforward but has subtle aspects (space handling vs comma quoting) that require docstring to fully understand. Uses outdated Python 2 syntax (u prefixes, % formatting) which reduces modern readability. The continue/elif structure is slightly awkward but functional. Overall well-structured but could be more self-documenting.","tokens":1790,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"68","reasoning":"Code shows redundant and duplicate urllib imports creating confusion. Contains unused imports adding noise. Uses outdated Python 2 class syntax. Despite clear variable names and simple structure these issues reduce readability. Minimal functionality shown makes full assessment difficult.","tokens":1613,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Clear docstring explains purpose. Simple structure with minimal code. However, import from __init__ is unconventional and requires project context. The totest dictionary structure is cryptic without documentation. The main block is incomplete, only importing unittest without using it. Very short length aids comprehension but some patterns are framework-specific.","tokens":1538,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"Code shows Python 2 legacy with has_key method and confusing while-else construct that misuses loop semantics. Broad exception handling hides errors. Inline comments are redundant and spacing is inconsistent. Function names and docstrings are clear but overall style is dated and contains anti-patterns that hinder quick comprehension and maintainability.","tokens":3336,"name":"53.jsnp"}
{"score":"68","reasoning":"Code snippet shows relative import resolution but lacks function definition for first part uses outdated Python 2 syntax xrange and old string formatting. String manipulation logic is dense without inline comments. While docstrings and error messages are clear the algorithm requires deep Python import knowledge. Modern Python practices and more comments would improve readability.","tokens":1951,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"Uses unidiomatic Java-style getters/setters instead of Python properties. Violates PEP 8 by mixing camelCase and snake_case. Contains commented-out code clutter.

Requires moderate effort to comprehend due to inconsistencies.","tokens":4062,"name":"91.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"Test methods are well-named with clear intent. Variable names are descriptive and tests follow consistent arrange-act-assert pattern. However first test has confusing logic with unreachable code and self.fail call. Second class lacks comments for non-obvious expectations like week number calculations. Pragma comments may distract casual readers. Overall structure is good but could be more straightforward.","tokens":1887,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"40","reasoning":"Code shows poor readability due to dangerous dict mutation during iteration, outdated Python 2 syntax, hardcoded paths, mixed logging styles, global state manipulation via os.chdir, and dead commented code.
