Mixed responsibilities and magic constants reduce clarity. Overall readability is moderate but could be improved with modern Python idioms and better naming.","tokens":1256,"name":"24.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code uses clear function names and a docstring, simple loops and list comprehensions make the logic easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive and the handling of different parameter types is straightforward. Minor drawbacks are missing imports, undefined pathdefs and lack of type hints which slightly reduce clarity.","tokens":1299,"name":"76.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet uses clear naming, consistent indentation, and docstrings that explain purpose of classes and methods. Variable names like rect, close_button_state, and out_tab_rect are descriptive. The flow is straightforward, but the excerpt is incomplete, lacking surrounding context and some definitions, which slightly reduces overall clarity.","tokens":614,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"The test classes are clearly named and each test method describes its purpose, making intent easy to grasp. Standard unittest assertions are used and the datetime API calls are straightforward. Minor drawbacks include missing import statements, a few long lines, and an unnecessary try/except block that could be simplified. Overall readability is strong.","tokens":1171,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet is simple mapping of color names to hex codes and helper functions, but it repeats many similar assignments, contains typos (fuscia, white to bold) and undefined keys, lacks comments and initial dictionary definition, which reduces clarity. The functions are clear but overall readability is moderate.","tokens":1348,"name":"69.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear naming but repeats import statements which adds noise. The class definition is simple with only two attributes and a dictionary, making it easy to follow. Lack of methods or comments limits context, reducing overall comprehension.","tokens":776,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"The code mixes global state, undefined functions, missing imports and Python2 print syntax, making it hard to follow. Variable names are unclear, loops are verbose, and error handling is minimal. Formatting is inconsistent and comments are absent, reducing readability significantly.","tokens":1154,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code follows Python conventions with clear docstrings, descriptive names and straightforward logic, making it easy to follow. Imports are organized and the class purpose is well explained. The apply method is concise. However the snippet ends abruptly without the else clause, which hampers completeness and slightly lowers the score","tokens":1003,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The snippet is short, properly indented and uses clear try/except blocks for imports. However it mixes German variable names with English code, lacks comments or a docstring, uses Python2 print syntax and magic numbers, which reduces overall readability and comprehension.","tokens":834,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The function has a clear docstring, descriptive variable names and straightforward logic. It iterates over tags, handles commas and spaces, chooses a delimiter and returns the joined string. Minor issues are the unnecessary unicode prefixes and a slightly implicit use_commas flag, but overall the code is easy to read and understand","tokens":987,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is fairly readable with clear variable names and a helpful docstring, but it mixes error handling with string manipulation, uses the older xrange function, and lacks explicit imports which can confuse readers. The logic for counting leading dots and resolving the name is straightforward but could be clearer with comments. Overall comprehension is moderate.","tokens":965,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is short and uses familiar Python constructs like os.listdir and os.path.isdir, making the flow easy to follow. However it mixes HTML with Python strings, uses Python2 print syntax, and contains a typo in the href attribute that reduces clarity. Variable names are clear but missing context for listPath. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":697,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear function names, but it mixes Python2 syntax, has a missing call to main, and uses old Qt signal syntax which reduces readability; error handling is simple but the overall flow is easy to follow for someone familiar with PyQt","tokens":853,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is short well structured and self explanatory with clear header docstring simple function and data definition making it easy to follow though limited complexity keeps it from a perfect score","tokens":801,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The script is short and its flow is easy to follow but it lacks documentation, uses ambiguous attribute names, hard coded values and Python2 print syntax. Error handling is missing and some imports are unused, which reduces overall clarity and maintainability","tokens":1021,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is simple and self explanatory, defining a list of snooze options with localized strings. However inconsistent quoting, long line breaks, and an incomplete list syntax reduce clarity. Minor style issues and missing closing bracket make it harder to read, keeping the score moderate","tokens":921,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code follows standard unittest structure with clear method names and consistent indentation. Variable names are descriptive and the helper assertIcon makes tests concise. Dependencies are abstracted so the logic is easy to follow. Minor lack of comments and docstrings prevents a perfect score","tokens":869,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code imports many modules which can be overwhelming and uses Python2 specific imports that are less familiar today, and it lacks docstrings, but class and method names are clear and the logic is straightforward, making it moderately readable but not highly clean","tokens":954,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet defines three Django models with clear field names and simple __unicode__ methods. Consistent formatting and Meta ordering improve readability. However it lacks docstrings, uses the deprecated __unicode__ instead of __str__, and provides no comments, which slightly reduces comprehension.","tokens":731,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The module is short and self contained. A clear docstring explains purpose, __docformat__ is set, and the variable name labels describes its content. The dictionary is neatly formatted with one entry per line, making the German translations easy to scan. No complex logic or dependencies are present, so comprehension is straightforward.","tokens":996,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear function names, but it mixes Python2 syntax, has a missing call to main, and uses a global timer variable. Error handling messages are verbose and interrupt flow. The overall logic is understandable, yet outdated syntax and incomplete main guard lower readability.","tokens":954,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear naming for version and scheduler types. Constants are uppercase which aids comprehension. Functions for brushes are simple but named like constants, which may confuse readers. Indentation uses tabs and spacing is inconsistent, deviating from PEP8. Overall readability is moderate, earning a score around 70","tokens":935,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code mixes clear loops and descriptive variable names with confusing practices such as deleting items from a dictionary while iterating and using undefined globals. It relies on Python2 syntax, magic numbers and hard coded paths which reduce readability. Comments are sparse and some functions lack documentation, making overall comprehension moderate but not easy.","tokens":1264,"name":"17.jsnp"}
