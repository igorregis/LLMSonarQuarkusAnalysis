Formatting is acceptable but overall comprehension is limited","tokens":488,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is short and follows a linear flow making it easy to follow. Variable names are clear and error checks are present for memory allocation. However missing includes for stdio and stdlib, lack of cuda error handling, no cudaFree, and commented out sections reduce clarity. Overall readability is good but could be improved","tokens":962,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The function is short and uses clear variable names for matrix dimensions. Comments separate the update of H and W, aiding comprehension. However kernel launch parameters and helper functions are not defined in this snippet, requiring external knowledge. Overall the code is moderately readable but could be clearer with more inline explanation.","tokens":993,"name":"75.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The snippet is incomplete and lacks context, making it hard to understand its purpose. The bitwise sequence is a known power-of-two trick but is not explained, and the kernel definition is cut off without a body or comments. Variable names are generic, reducing clarity","tokens":715,"name":"29.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code follows a straightforward sequence of CUDA allocation, host initialization, copy to device, clear host, copy back and print. Variable names are clear but there are no comments, no error messages, magic numbers and missing context such as includes or a main function reduce readability. Overall moderate clarity","tokens":815,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear naming for variables and CUDA calls, making it fairly readable for developers familiar with CUDA. However the lack of comments, missing parameter documentation and reliance on macros reduces clarity for newcomers. Overall readability is moderate, earning a score around 70.","tokens":683,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"The macro defines a long kernel with many cryptic variables and nested macros, making it hard to follow. Lack of comments, dense one‑liner macro, and mixed naming conventions reduce clarity. Some structure is present but overall readability is poor, leading to a low score.","tokens":1501,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"68","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable; clear variable names and comments explain steps, but long lines, repeated fetches, and magic constants reduce clarity. Indentation is inconsistent and braces are misplaced. Overall comprehension is decent for experienced CUDA developers but could be improved","tokens":997,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The snippet consists solely of repeated macro calls with sequential numbers and provides no context, comments, or definitions. While the pattern is simple, the lack of explanation makes it hard to understand the purpose or behavior of the macro, reducing readability and comprehension significantly.","tokens":574,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code uses clear naming for RBM components and follows typical CUDA patterns, but the mixture of macros, long parameter lists, and lack of comments make it harder to follow. Variable names are descriptive but the conditional kernel selection and magic constants reduce clarity, leading to moderate readability","tokens":1287,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"45","reasoning":"The snippet mixes high level matrix calls with low level CUDA kernel launches and contains commented out code which adds visual clutter. Variable names such as W V aux deltaH2 are not explained and the sequence of operations is not documented making the flow hard to follow for readers unfamiliar with the library","tokens":821,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"The snippet only contains header includes and a single macro definition without any functional code or comments. The purpose of the includes is unclear and the macro name gives little insight into its use, making the snippet hard to understand and low in readability","tokens":537,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet is very short and contains only macro definitions and a commented out include line. While the macros are simple, the lack of explanatory comments, potential macro name clashes, and missing context reduce readability. The code is easy to parse but offers little insight into its purpose, leading to a moderate score.","tokens":583,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code follows a clear pattern but repeats the same three line block for each axis which makes it verbose and harder to maintain. Variable names are descriptive enough and the final gradient computation is straightforward, however the nested loops and repeated calculations reduce overall readability","tokens":953,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The snippet is fragmented and missing context. Variable declarations are incomplete, braces are unbalanced, and key variables like sum are undeclared. Naming is inconsistent and comments are absent, making the flow hard to follow. The CUDA launch code is present but the kernel body is cut off, reducing overall clarity","tokens":849,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The snippet is moderately readable. Indentation and naming are clear and the logic follows a typical CUDA weight update pattern. However the mix of many conditionals, implicit loop bounds and lack of explanatory comments make it harder to follow quickly. A score of 70 reflects decent but not excellent clarity.","tokens":993,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The snippet uses macro backslashes, long unbroken lines and many cryptic names making the flow hard to follow. Magic constants and index calculations are not explained and there are no comments. Although indentation is present, the dense logic and repeated patterns reduce readability significantly","tokens":1562,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"The snippet is dense and hard to follow. It uses long parameter lists, many single‑letter variables, and macro concatenation that obscure intent. Lack of comments and excessive line continuations reduce clarity. While it follows CUDA patterns, the heavy use of shared memory, custom functions and unclear naming make comprehension difficult for most readers","tokens":1538,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code follows typical CUDA patterns with shared memory and thread synchronization, making the algorithm recognizable to experienced GPU programmers. Variable names are short but convey their role and the flow is logical. However the snippet lacks full context, declarations and comments, and the indentation is uneven, which reduces clarity for newcomers.","tokens":1016,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet uses standard CUDA constructs but lacks comments and contains typographical errors in function and variable names that hinder understanding Variable names are short but clear and the calculation of grid size is straightforward Overall readability is moderate but could be improved with better naming and documentation","tokens":764,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code follows a simple linked list removal pattern and basic initialization, but lacks clear comments, consistent formatting, and proper error handling. Variable declarations for dummy structures are missing, and the use of self‑referencing pointers without explanation makes the flow harder to follow, reducing overall readability","tokens":1082,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The fragment is short and lacks context, contains commented out code and a TODO note, making its purpose unclear. Indentation is inconsistent and there are stray comments that interrupt flow. Variable names are not shown, so understanding is difficult, resulting in low readability.","tokens":745,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is well indented and uses clear variable names, consistent error handling and helpful messages. Comments explain each step and the logic follows a typical socket setup pattern, making it easy to follow. Minor issues include missing context such as includes and the abrupt end, but overall readability is high","tokens":906,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The snippet uses clear variable names and simple arithmetic making the intent easy to follow. Lack of comments and surrounding context limits understanding but the operations are straightforward and self explanatory resulting in a moderate readability rating.","tokens":870,"name":"8.jsnp"}
