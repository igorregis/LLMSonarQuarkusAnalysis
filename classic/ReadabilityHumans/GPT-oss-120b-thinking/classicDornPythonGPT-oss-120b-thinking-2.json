{"score":"35","reasoning":"The code mixes global state, undefined functions, missing imports and Python2 print syntax, making it hard to follow. Variable names are unclear, loops are verbose, and error handling is minimal. Formatting is inconsistent and comments are absent, reducing readability significantly.","tokens":986,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is short and well indented but mixes languages in variable names, lacks comments or docstrings, uses Python2 print syntax and does not handle a cancelled file dialog. Imports are guarded with clear messages. Overall readability is moderate but could be improved","tokens":807,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear naming but repeats import statements which adds noise. The class definition is simple with only two attributes and a dictionary, making it easy to follow. Lack of methods limits context but overall readability is moderate due to straightforward structure","tokens":778,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet uses clear naming, consistent indentation, and docstrings that explain purpose of classes and methods. Variable names like rect, close_button_state, and out_tab_rect are descriptive. The flow is straightforward, but the excerpt is incomplete, lacking surrounding context and some definitions, which slightly reduces overall clarity.","tokens":614,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code follows a consistent style and uses descriptive names which makes the flow easy to follow. However it lacks docstrings, inline comments and the get_charset_name method is not implemented, which reduces overall clarity. The logic is straightforward but could be better documented.","tokens":1250,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"84","reasoning":"The test classes are clearly named and each test method describes its purpose, making intent easy to grasp. Standard unittest assertions are used and the datetime API calls are straightforward. Minor drawbacks include missing import statements, a few long lines, and an unnecessary try/except block that could be simplified. Overall readability is strong.","tokens":1171,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"The code is clear and well‑structured with a descriptive variable name and consistent formatting. The use of localized strings improves readability for internationalization. Minor issues such as a missing closing bracket and an incomplete list reduce completeness, but overall the snippet is easy to understand.","tokens":762,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear class and method names, making the flow easy to follow. However it lacks docstrings, contains several unused attributes, magic strings and numbers, and minimal error handling, which reduces overall readability and maintainability.","tokens":913,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The function has a clear docstring, descriptive variable names and straightforward logic. It iterates over tags, handles commas and spaces, chooses a delimiter and returns the joined string. Minor issues are the unnecessary unicode prefixes and a slightly implicit use_commas flag, but overall the code is easy to read and understand","tokens":987,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code is fairly straightforward with simple dictionary assignments and small helper functions, but it suffers from several issues that hurt readability. Inconsistent naming, a typo in fuscia, missing definitions for bold and reset, and redundant assignments make the logic harder to follow. The functions are short and clear, yet the overall structure could be cleaner.","tokens":1314,"name":"69.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code follows a clear structure with imports grouped logically and small helper classes that have descriptive names. Variable and method names are meaningful and the flow is easy to follow. Use of Python2 specific modules and lack of docstrings reduce clarity slightly, but overall readability is good","tokens":911,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is short and uses familiar Python constructs like os.listdir and os.path.isdir, making the flow easy to follow. However it mixes HTML with Python strings, uses Python2 print syntax, and contains a typo in the href attribute that reduces clarity. Variable names are clear but missing context for listPath. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":697,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code is well structured with clear docstrings, descriptive variable names and logical flow, making it easy to follow. Imports are organized and the class purpose is explained. However the snippet ends abruptly at an incomplete else block, which hampers full understanding and reduces the overall score.","tokens":1217,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear Python syntax. The __eq__ method handles missing attributes with a try except which works but could be expressed more idiomatically. The else clause returns a new instance using self.__class__, which is understandable. Overall readability is good but not optimal, resulting in a score around 78","tokens":864,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is short well structured and self explanatory with clear header docstring simple function and data definition making it easy to follow though limited complexity keeps it from a perfect score","tokens":801,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet defines three Django models with clear field names and simple __unicode__ methods. Consistent formatting and Meta ordering improve readability. However it lacks docstrings, uses the deprecated __unicode__ instead of __str__, and provides no comments, which slightly reduces comprehension.","tokens":731,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear function names, but it mixes Python2 syntax, has a missing call to main, and uses old Qt signal syntax which reduces readability; error handling is simple but the overall flow is easy to follow for someone familiar with PyQt","tokens":853,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code uses clear variable names and a helpful docstring, making the purpose of the functions obvious. The logic for counting leading dots and resolving relative imports is straightforward, though the use of xrange indicates an older Python version and the surrounding context such as imports is missing. Overall readability is good but not perfect","tokens":930,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear function names, but it mixes Python2 syntax, has a missing call to main, and uses old Qt signal syntax which reduces readability; error handling is simple but the overall flow is easy to follow for someone familiar with PyQt","tokens":853,"name":"63.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The module starts with a clear docstring and sets __docformat__, then defines a well‑named dictionary mapping English labels to German equivalents. Each entry is on its own line, making the mapping easy to read. There is no complex logic, only a stray string after the dict which is harmless but slightly unconventional.","tokens":879,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code follows standard unittest structure with clear method names and consistent indentation. Variable names are descriptive and the helper assertIcon makes tests concise. Dependencies are abstracted so the logic is easy to follow. Minor lack of comments and docstrings prevents a perfect score","tokens":869,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet is short and organized with clear constant names and simple functions. Naming is consistent but using functions for what appear to be constants may cause slight confusion. Minor formatting inconsistencies such as mixed tabs and spaces are present, yet the overall logic is straightforward and easy to understand.","tokens":891,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The code follows a simple procedural style but mixes concerns and uses outdated Python 2 constructs. Variable names are short and some are undefined in the snippet which hurts comprehension. Deleting items from a dictionary while iterating is unsafe. Indentation is clear but comments are sparse and some magic values appear. Overall readability is moderate leading to a score of 55","tokens":1256,"name":"17.jsnp"}
