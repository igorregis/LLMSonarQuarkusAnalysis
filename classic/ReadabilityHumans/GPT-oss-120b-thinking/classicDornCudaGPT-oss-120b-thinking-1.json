Overall comprehension is moderate but could be improved.","tokens":1405,"name":"94.jsnp"}
{"score":"30","reasoning":"The snippet is dense, uses macro backslashes, long unbroken lines and cryptic names. Index calculations and magic constants are not explained, and there are no comments. The flow is hard to follow, making comprehension difficult for most readers.","tokens":1436,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear macro definitions, but the commented out include line and macro MAX without parentheses around parameters can cause subtle bugs. Overall readability is decent but could be improved, leading to a moderate score.","tokens":554,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"45","reasoning":"The snippet mixes brief comments with code, uses short variable names and CUDA specific calls without explanation, includes commented out lines, and lacks context for the operations, making the flow hard to follow and reducing overall readability","tokens":846,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses standard CUDA primitives but variable names are cryptic and lack documentation making it harder to follow. Control flow is simple with nested if statements, but repeated patterns and missing context reduce readability. Overall readability is moderate","tokens":857,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code follows a clear pattern but repeats the same three‑line block for each axis instead of using a loop, making it longer than necessary. Variable names are descriptive and the final gradient calculation is straightforward, but the nested braces and lack of abstraction reduce readability.","tokens":918,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"35","reasoning":"The code uses a massive macro to generate a CUDA kernel, which makes it hard to read. Variable names are short and cryptic, many magic constants and external functions are referenced without explanation. Lack of comments and heavy line continuation reduce clarity. While the logical flow is roughly understandable, overall readability is low, earning a score around 35.","tokens":1648,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"40","reasoning":"The snippet mixes host and device code without clear separation, lacks proper indentation and missing braces make the flow ambiguous.
