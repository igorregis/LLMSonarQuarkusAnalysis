Variable names are unclear, loops are verbose, and error handling is minimal. Formatting is inconsistent and comments are absent, reducing readability significantly.","tokens":986,"name":"71.jsnp"}
{"score":"45","reasoning":"The code mixes a raw mapping with a class that uses outdated Python constructs such as has_key and unnecessary semicolons. Variable names are short, indentation is inconsistent, and comments are sparse. The logic is hard to follow because of alternating colour toggling without explanation. Overall readability is below average.","tokens":969,"name":"75.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear naming but repeats import statements which adds noise. The class definition is simple with only two attributes and a dictionary, making it easy to follow. Lack of methods limits context but overall readability is moderate due to straightforward structure","tokens":778,"name":"48.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The script is short and follows a simple flow, imports are guarded with try except, and the logic for sizing is clear. However variable names mix languages, there are no comments, no main guard, and error handling is minimal, which reduces readability. Overall it is moderately easy to follow","tokens":881,"name":"32.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet uses clear class and method names, docstrings, and consistent indentation which aid readability. Variable names are descriptive and the flow is straightforward. However the code is incomplete, lacking context for some referenced functions and variables, which slightly reduces comprehension. Overall it is well‑structured but could be clearer with full definitions.","tokens":617,"name":"40.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code follows Python conventions with clear class and method names, docstrings and inheritance hierarchy. Indentation and spacing are consistent, making it easy to follow. Minor issues include an empty return in get_chassis, an assert without message and a hard-coded slot assignment that may confuse readers, slightly lowering readability.","tokens":1350,"name":"78.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is short, well‑structured and self‑explanatory; clear docstring, descriptive names and simple data structures make it easy to follow, though it lacks extensive comments and type hints which could improve clarity further","tokens":763,"name":"38.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code follows a clear class structure and uses descriptive names for most variables and methods. The logic in feed is straightforward but dense, with nested conditionals and no comments, making it harder for a newcomer. Missing implementation for get_charset_name and limited docstrings reduce clarity. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":1184,"name":"4.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The function has a clear docstring, descriptive variable names and straightforward logic. It iterates over tags, handles commas and spaces, chooses a delimiter and returns the joined string. Minor issues are the unnecessary unicode prefixes and a slightly implicit use_commas flag, but overall the code is easy to read and understand","tokens":1003,"name":"22.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear class and method names, making the flow easy to follow. However many attributes are initialized but never used, and the code lacks documentation, error handling and type hints. The import of vboxcontroller_4_1 is opaque and the loop logic is simple but the purpose is not fully explained, reducing clarity.","tokens":1029,"name":"30.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is fairly readable with clear variable names and a helpful docstring, but it mixes error handling with string manipulation, uses the older xrange function, and lacks explicit imports which can confuse readers. The logic for counting leading dots and resolving the name is straightforward but could be clearer with comments. Overall comprehension is moderate.","tokens":1000,"name":"77.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is short and uses familiar Python constructs like os.listdir and os.path.isdir, making the flow easy to follow. However it mixes HTML with Python strings, uses Python2 print syntax, and contains a typo in the href attribute that reduces clarity. Variable names are clear but missing context for listPath. Overall readability is moderate.","tokens":697,"name":"117.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The tests are well named and use clear variable names making the intent obvious. Each method checks a single behavior of the custom DateTime class. However the snippet omits imports, relies on external test framework, and contains a try/except block that hides the expected failure, which slightly reduces readability. Overall the code is easy to follow.","tokens":1274,"name":"84.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet defines three Django models with clear field names and simple __unicode__ methods. Consistent formatting and Meta ordering improve readability. However it lacks docstrings, uses the deprecated __unicode__ instead of __str__, and provides no comments, which slightly reduces comprehension.","tokens":731,"name":"45.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is simple and self explanatory, defining a list of snooze options with localized strings. However inconsistent quoting, long line breaks, and an incomplete list syntax reduce clarity. Minor style issues and missing closing bracket make it harder to read, keeping the score moderate.","tokens":920,"name":"109.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code imports many modules which can be overwhelming and uses Python2 specific imports that are less familiar today, and it lacks docstrings, but class and method names are clear and the logic is straightforward, making it moderately readable but not highly clean","tokens":954,"name":"8.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The snippet is short and uses clear Python syntax. The __eq__ method handles missing attributes with a try except which works but could be expressed more idiomatically. The else clause returns a new instance using self.__class__, which is understandable. Overall readability is good but not optimal, so a score around 78","tokens":863,"name":"1.jsnp"}
{"score":"78","reasoning":"The code is well structured with clear docstrings, descriptive variable names and logical flow, making it easy to follow. Imports are organized and the class purpose is explained. However the snippet ends abruptly at an incomplete else block, which hampers full understanding and reduces the overall score.","tokens":1217,"name":"44.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code follows standard unittest structure with clear method names and consistent indentation. Variable names are descriptive and the helper assertIcon makes tests concise. Dependencies are abstracted so the logic is easy to follow. Minor lack of comments and docstrings prevents a perfect score","tokens":869,"name":"37.jsnp"}
{"score":"92","reasoning":"The module defines a clear docstring, a docformat marker and a single dictionary named labels that maps English keys to German strings. Variable naming is self-explanatory, the mapping is formatted line-by-line for easy scanning, and there is no complex logic. Overall the code is concise and highly readable.","tokens":915,"name":"15.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear function names, but it mixes Python2 syntax, has a missing call to main, and uses old Qt signal syntax which reduces readability; error handling is simple but the overall flow is easy to follow for someone familiar with PyQt","tokens":867,"name":"108.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is short and uses clear naming for constants and functions, making the purpose obvious. However the mix of uppercase constants with function names that look like constants, and the lack of docstrings or comments explaining the values reduces clarity. Overall readability is decent but could be improved","tokens":857,"name":"54.jsnp"}
{"score":"55","reasoning":"Code is Python 2 style with print statements and old file handling. Variable names are short and some are undefined making it hard to follow. Loop that deletes items from a dict while iterating is unsafe. Indentation is clear but mixed use of magic numbers and hard coded paths reduces clarity. Overall readability is moderate but could be improved","tokens":1288,"name":"17.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The script is short and uses clear naming, but mixes old Python 2 syntax, lacks docstrings for functions, and has an incomplete main guard at the end. Error handling is straightforward, but the use of a global timer and Qt signal syntax reduces readability for modern readers. Overall it is moderately easy to follow","tokens":963,"name":"63.jsnp"}
